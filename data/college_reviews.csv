0,"MIT... Name is enough...Fascinating Campus!

As a tourist, I found out MIT is a cooler place to visit than Harvard.  I mean for the architecture, the stories, and the cool things going on in the school.  The engineering building was the coolest to see.
 You definitely need to plan ahead as they have limited space. The hour information session could have been condensed to 35 minutes, but otherwise was very helpful. The walking tour was more informative. The campus is beautiful with many unique buildings.
Stroll through Killian's Court and take a walk on the riverside to see the crew teams and sailing teams as they practice and race on the Charles River.","The World Class University has got the World Class Campus. Could not study here but even a visit to its campus is like dreams coming true.

Land scaling is awesome so as students in large number moving around from one department to another on by-cycles. Do not forget to climb Hoover Tower and have an birds eye view of the entire Stanford University Campus. Entrance fee is nominal and ample parking place. Concept of Lap-Top with Coffee is good and many students can be seen here. 

One can take Campus Shuttle and move around the campus. 

Enjoy please.",I taught here for half a day… But I’ve known faculty here for years. Their programs are top-notch inter-disciplinary and encourage problem solving and critical thinking… They also have a keen focus on geospatial technology.… Design and much more.  But the campus also is beautiful.,"School's reputation speaks for itself. It's a great undergraduate program, although known worldwide more for its graduate programs, many of which are top 5 in the world. There are so many undergraduates that it can sometimes feel impersonal, but joining on campus groups and making friends in the dorms can mitigate that. There's not much grade inflation like at the Ivy League schools, so if you do poorly in a course, you can easily get a D or F, whereas at Ivies the professors likely wouldn't give lower than a C-. Can be tough academically.","(I am writing this review from a 'location' perspective only, as I did not attend any classes here.)

Very beautiful, historic campus. Great location, with plenty to see and do nearby. Large, impressive library. Fun to tour!","I was in utter shock to discover that this citadel of learning was founded in 1746 and feel privileged too to experience its serene atmosphere first-hand. 

There are more than enough signages to guide and provide directions from one end to the other - for motorists, bikers and pedestrians which make it effortless to navigate and move around without much of human help.","The University of Toronto (U of T, UToronto, or Toronto) is a public research university in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on the grounds that surround Queen's Park. It was founded by royal charter in 1827 as King's College, the first institution of higher learning in the colony of Upper Canada. Originally controlled by the Church of England, the university assumed the present name in 1850 upon becoming a secular institution. As a collegiate university, it comprises eleven colleges, which differ in character and history, each with substantial autonomy on financial and institutional affairs. It has two satellite campuses    '' 'in Scarborough and Mississauga.","Wish I could study here, guys apply to UCLA today if your planning on studying abroad. It’s a great university with everything state of the art that students need. Campus is huge with even bigger classy buildings and class rooms. Very safe to be in the campus and very friendly staff.","Easily one of the best places I've ever worked in my 7+ year professional career. The campus is, of course, architecturally and ecologically one of the prettiest in the nation -- and visits to the library were always super productive.",There's so much to say. All I will say is everything that glitters isn't gold. I love the accessibility of the equipment for classes...when it works.,"The university was established 1891. The university Motto ""The truth shall make you free"". University location ""Pasadena, California, U,S"". It is a private university.  University nakename ""Beavens"". Any engineering students helpful & big opportunity this university campus. Environment good. Transportation & Communication good.","We went for a campus tour and I loved the campus. Although it was cold and snowing, the snow on the trees was lovely and the buildings looked so majestic. I liked that the campus was like its own world...when you enter the gates it's almost like you're not in New York anymore.  The tour was organized into small groups depending on what major you were interested in. The guides were friendly and knowledgeable  and the presentation was very informative.",My father used to cover upstate New York since he worked at Waters associated company dealing with laboratory equipments it's a great place,"Over the years, the University of Texas at Austin has developed and built the campus into an increasingly beautiful place. There are innumerable study spots and incredible views to be found all over campus. Further, they've been working on street infrastructure to make campus walk-areas safer and more accessible to pedestrians or bikers. Overall, great university.","Very good university with an amazing study and research environment...
Located into the small cities of Urbana and Champaign is an important focus of knowledge of the Illinois State.","The City of New York, often called New York City (NYC) or simply New York (NY), is the most populous city in the United States.[9] With an estimated 2017 population of 8,622,698[7] distributed over a land area of about 302.6 square miles (784 km2),[10][11] New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.[12] Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass[13] and one of the world's most populous megacities,[14][15] with an estimated 20,320,876 people in its 2017 Metropolitan Statistical Area and 23,876,155 residents in its Combined Statistical Area.[4][5] A global power city,[16] New York City has been described uniquely[17] as the cultural,[18][19][20][21] financial,[22][23] and media capital of the world,[24][25] and exerts a significant impact upon commerce,[23] entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports.

The environment is very good. Awesome beaches around the university. Very cool place for study. Just love it.,"Strange people over there. I regret my visit. I wish I did not have to know that my diploma came from there. Not like the old days where knowledge was the most important. Not sure where the American college system is heading, but it looks to be going down hill to me.",Yale University was one of the best place that I have ever gone to. The architecture of the University is very old style and was very incredible. I would recommend you to take a tour if you are looking to attend or to just visit.,"Very fun environment. Place huge, you can have nice walk around the campus. Their library is the best place, 8 floors tall structure built in a shape of a spaceship kind of a thing. You will have best view of the campus from their. UCSD also has a nice Thai food joint and in their Price Center you will have different kind of food joints. Vivid place with people from different culture.","On 10/12/18 Michigan Tour guide Raoul seems to dislike ""rich white men that donate 100 million dollars"" to build a business school.  Does it matter what skin color a man has Raoul?  I thought you would not judge a man by his skin color or by how much money he has.  What a poor representative to such an allegedly prestigious University.","Don’t go here!

This place has a “believe all women” policy. Someone accuses you wrongly, you’ll be expelled. What a hassle. Pick a better school that will respect you.","I am a current student here. Beware if you are looking to go to this school. The name is good... But let's be honest here, it's not Ivy League. Despite that fact, they make you work like a dog for your mediocre grades. I'm talking 150 page papers... 2hr midterms that end at 9pm and then you start another 2hr midterm the next morning at 9am. It's unnecessarily relentless. They push too hard. Also a lot of professors here are terrible. Use ratemyprofessor or a website like it. If you don't you will truly suffer. Plenty are good... But you have to make sure you get the good ones. That's totally up to you. I'm just surprised that for about $75,000 a year they can't manage better. And yes, that's how much it will cost to attend every year if you don't have financial aid or scholarships.... Now that the rant is over I have to add the campus is unbelievably beautiful and it's an awesome location in Boston.","Beautiful campus!!! Parking is rough but worth it. Fantastic architecture, famous locations and friendly staff.","This is a very beautiful school, a garden-ish campus. Professors here are helpful and devoted to their work, students here are very diligent and smart.","The research driven university is good if you try yourself and find professors to work with. Other than that the administration including libraries, residence, meal plans, on-campus cafes, textbooks, etc they will try everything that they can to misinform you and get the most money out of you. This has been my consistent experience at McGill during my 4 years there. You are on your own.","I have received a great education from Penn State University at affordable tuition compared to other colleges around.  I'm well pleased with the quality of education I received from Penn State. Professors were very knowledgeable and willing to help you. Consider tutoring services on your Penn State campus. They have valuable resources to help you to become successful student! Great opportunities to meet new friends and attend a variety of clubs and events on Penn State campus. 

Best of luck to all of future prospective students at Penn State! 

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree Nursing. I did very well and Penn State nursing has did a wonderful job with helping me to prepare myself for the NCLEX.  For future nursing students, consider Penn State as your choice for great quality of nursing education!! 😊","Purdue is World-famous for its Engineering School, consistently top-ranked by the main reviewers in the USA, UK, and China. Vet Medicine, Agriculture, Business and Chemistry schools are also well-renowned globally. Costs are below the average of top US public universities. Very open for international students and definitely not for lazy people.",I recommend this school for any resident in Orange County,"Great institute, there are also amazing historic buildings and great architecture. There are a lot of great program and the fact that this University is consistent in high rankings is just amazing. There are a lot to offer for most students, it's great that they half of the campus is open to the public. Absolutely wonderful.",Terrible University. They might as well just call themselves a morgue. You should apply somewhere else. This college will not prepare you for the future and their bachelor degree is the equivalent of a middle school diploma. Not very useful when job searching. Employers will take one look at your academic history and laugh you out of the interview. The Regents are all incompetent. You can't trust them with young adults.,"Beautiful campus, felt very safe there. Love the university store, the badgers throughout the area and the food trucks. Great experience; felt lucky to have been on this campus!",Great university. Very modern buildings. Good student life.,"Love the university. Has great facilities and education of course. Other than that, the best part is the lake and the beach. It is also conveniently located near Evanston downtown with a lot of good restaurants and bars around. Chicago downtown is just a train ride away.","Place of Academic Education and Training:

It's the best educational institution in the province, and is currently ranked about 94th in the world, which is phenomenal when you consider that the world has over 22,000 universities.  The campus population is about 30,000. Upgrades to the campus have been well done, but the old Lister Hall residences still need to be overhauled in order to be bearable. The English department is just as wonky as ever, but the U of A is holding its own over the decades.  A degree you can be proud of.","I went to school here and it was great! The weather is four season The football team rules. The campus is perfectly planed out; And the administration and staff seem to really care here. I earned my bachelors here, and would do it all over again. It was a great education.",Great experience. Wonderful setting. World-class education.,"Love UNC Chapel Hill. The Hospital is steps away and they have a great medical school and dental school. Have so many great resources and have good vibes. 

GO TAR HEELS!!!!",The new remodel looks great! Always a great time at ASU stadium unfortunately my Utes didn't Prevail this time.,"Very lovely looking place with good variety of beer. Variety of food as well. Maybe too random? But it's good :) at least nothing to complain about.

Ah well. You can't bring your dog.",I Loved everything about this campus! From the wide open spaces to the community spirit among all Spartans you can truly feel like you're at home among this group of people. I hope to join the 2019 class of Spartans for these exact reasons. There is something to do every day of the week and you can tell they really focus on making a positive view of themselves involving school work and team spirit!,"Home to the Institute for Advanced Analytics, NC State offers the country’s premier graduate program for data savvy professionals—the Master of Science in Analytics. Since 2007, the Institute has succeeded in launching the careers of hundreds of data scientists, a decade before most businesses knew they needed one. Love data? Study here and join the ranks of NC State’s most sought-after and highest paid graduates.","I will never go back to that educational institution that anyone who goes there, good luck paying bills or loans you have to pay off from the institution that’ll harm your future not only loans but interests and other bad financial systems harming your employment and your investors cannot advocate bad credit ratings and poor economic management. As a former student whose pursuing current business ventures, education is a waste of time.","The student experience at this university is second to none. Kingston is a great university town. Most people live on campus which makes the community feel very close knit. The sports teams at this institution are well supported and a pillar of school spirit. 

The campus is beautiful and everything is walking distance. They have great support for mental health services. The Business Faculty is one of the best in the country and engineering are the heart and soul of Queen's craziness. The only thing it's still missing an ice rink.

Don't forget, Wuck Festern!",The rice  here is really good and the classes they teach about how to eat rice are very informative and detailed. 5/5 stars.,"I am officially a Rutgers graduate and I love this school because of the theater stuff, and the THEATER program [which Marshall has taught me about and therefore helped me go through that]; and the CREATIVE WRITING certificate program [which helped me improve my writing skills, I hope]. And I remember going to home football games.

I bet using my creative expression through writing helps me WAY BETTER now than that crappy COLLEGE SUPPORT PROGRAM, Dr. Siobhan, Ellen Shane, Pam Lubbers, and annoying Justin Kelley.","Absolutely no regard for student safety. My locker has been robbed twice, lost thousands of dollars in assets. And guess what - the gym area has NO security cameras - not even OUTSIDE of the locker room area. I do not feel safe in this school. I've filed two reports - and they've done absolutely nothing. They just say ""sorry!"".

They have destroyed the site Shame on you Texas A&M",The most beautiful campus in California and even in the USA. mild temperatures in all four season around the year and sunny almost always. Great area to walk in and even the surrounding Isla Vista is great.,"Senior year Computer Science major. Before coming here, I can promise you the experience will be bittersweet. Everything in this university is an uphill battle (contacting staff, fees, dirty bathrooms, terrible policies). Their faculty is ill-mannered and not helpful at all. It is very clear to see they only care about their salary rather than their students. Do not come here, you will not be welcomed. Quality of education is also very poor, you’re going to find yourself using outside (free) resources 95% of the time to complete all of your assignments.","Nice campus. Plenty of public transit options, but limited parking for personal vehicles. Bike racks abound. Several diverse and lower cost eating options in higher traffic areas.",a university that prides itself in being better than penn state. a beautiful campus on the outskirts of downtown pittsburgh,"For anyone with dermatologist appointments this is the best place to go. Thanks to a wonderful staff of doctors and assistants. I recommend this place to everyone.

I feel blessed and give thanks to McMaster University, My Mother and Father, and God.  Amen.","Recent college graduate, this school doesn't give you practical knowledge for real job/world. Accepted way too many students than it should have, and many of them are the rich kids from China and some other countries. There's only one tiny library that can't even accommodate half of the students, while there're new buildings of dorm and classrooms. You don't get the same return for what you paid for the sky high tuition and not being competitive enough for the area.","The university was established April 29, 1966. It is a public university. University motto ""I will left up my eyes"" University Nicknames ""Dinos"". University location Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It is best university. Whole campus environment best. Communication & transportation better.","Did a college visit summer 2018 with my twin boys.

The campus is beautiful and the immediate area around it is fantastic. 

No students there yet, but the location made a major impression on 2 potential applicants!",Loved the place. Huge University. The college of engineering is just awesome. If you are wish to pursue research contact the faculties before you join the university. It may take around 3-4 months to get an advisor here. I feel proud to be apart of such a prestigious university whose standards are getting better each year.,"Location - easy to get to by car or bus.
Facilities - always improving/upgrading and adding new and exciting spaces for staff and students - grounds are beautifully maintained.
Sports - as a spectator, I've enjoyed watching football, hockey, soccer and swimming events. There is something for everyone with an interest in participating in sports.
Academics - (last but not least) Excellent course offering. Both of my children graduated from Western (Ivey Business and Main Campus) with honours. If you put in the work, you can achieve the grades and as in both of my son's cases, find a great job upon graduation.

It's a close-knit community, a vibrant campus, and people are friendly and helpful to each other. Faculty members are very attentive to students, alumni do everything they can to support students to pursue a career path in a field they are connected to, and the student body is kind and talented. I enjoyed my time working at the College. It deserves its Ivy League rank.","Starting in Spring of 2019, already can tell it's a very prestigious college and is a NASA command center for some of the WILDCAT projects, WOW! BEAR DOWN!","Honestly, this university is riding on cherry picked reputations achieved years ago. They sold and manipulated me to pursue an undergraduate degree here. Although you'll find some good associate professors on the undergraduate side, going to upper years, especially in the engineering department, they may be super smart and super innovative on the research side, but from a teaching perspective, they make it ever so hard to even enjoy the content you're attempting to learn either because they cannot convey the material sufficiently or put unreasonable regulations and expectations of students. At this university, they assume good researcher = good teacher. Wrong. There is no standards for teaching which means you'll get professors all across the spectrum with no consistency whatsoever. 

And don't get me started on admin, if you need anything from them, you'll either spend hours on hold or wait weeks for emails to be replied to.

The co-op program? There's nothing special about it. They advertise there's an 80% placement rate but it's all government jobs. Government jobs have not helped me further my career, in my honest opinion. I've gotten better jobs looking for internships on my own. 

I've even found the cleanliness of the various facilities to be abysmal at best; if you want to build new buildings (which is fine), but at least maintain the buildings you already have. 

Website is hard to navigate, jobs on campus are hard to find and they are relatively disorganized as well. 

Some pros however, are the location (you're conviently located near the heart of the downtown core) and maybe the high-traffic bus terminals (you'll never miss a bus because there will probably be another one in 5-10 minutes.

I wish I had more nice things to say. Too bad.","It's a solid school and I have had a good experience in going here. However they actively cover up student suicides, especially in residence, while refusing to fund necessary mental health resources or cover them under the student health insurance plan. Counselling wait times are four months- too long for someone in crisis.",Best and most proficient staff of surgeons and nurses in this region. I personally know this from past surgeries as well as one yesterday (November 26th 2018) in which I have already been contacted by the staff concerned about my needs during my recovery. Vanderbilt VA hospital came highly recommended to me and I highly recommend this hospital and most proficient staff to you...,"Awesome school.  Prepared me for so many things in life.  I was a math-oriented student when I entered.  By the time I took the GMAT in my senior year, my verbal score exceeded my math score.",If I can give a 0 review I would. I came here thinkig it would be great. It was easy to train here cause it was one Go bus from mississauga. Now 3 years in. We had a strike and they're still trying to deal with it. They are now making busing harder for all their commuter students. York sucks all around. Go to a different school.,Very great institution and citadel of learning right in the heart of Washington DC! The environment is lit up with beautiful greenery and lots of attractions and fun spots. It's a nice time being here. Lovely people everywhere with the most amazing gestures I've ever seen. Great facilities too!,"I was a graduate architecture student here, and had a mental breakdown and dropped out when a fellow student Chendru Starkloff sabotaged my career. It was very traumatic, and I suffered PTSD, anxiety, and depression from it. That's a lot worse that the obvious stress of spending over $40 grand a year after considering all financial aid to encounter bad professors, sitting in front of the computer all day, bad weather, and crappy studio culture. Now Chendru Starkloff had graduated with honors, and is working for the Dean of the Architecture school, Evan Douglas. My experience with this school was reprehensible and evil.","I have not gone to school here myself, but I have been impressed by everyone I know who has gone to school here. Great football team too!","This school is absolutely beautiful. My daughter went here for 4 years. She lived in the dorms here for a year. Love that they have everything here, from food places to laundry facilities. She loved coming here.","One of a kind campus with a variety of advanced programs to match most interests. Hey, they mapped the human genome here and did it first,  so they must be doing something right. A good fit both for physically or intellectually active people and any combination of the two.

Professors are active in their field, top notch college/public radio station on board, and an unbeatable natural environment with highly competitive div 3 sports teams. I biked and walked all around campus even though shuttles are available.  I took classes from stag at the top of their field, produced an educational documentary, got licensed then programmed radio shows, and played on a national championship tennis team. Unofficial fight song of UCSC is also top notch even though it came out after i graduated. Check it out...

Close to a world class city San Francisco and has the ocean and bay add a backdrop and playground. Worth a visit if you're in the area to see how the buildings mesh (ala Frank Lloyd Wright) and are tucked into the natural environment. If nothing else visit for a hike, bike, run, or trip to the arboretum. Enjoy!",This is a very historic Catholic University.  The chapel and the grotto are just beautiful.  A must see for anyone who has a soul.,Good school and good campus. (For those who don't need financial aid),It is a good school and is not nearly as political as other reviews are making it out to seem. People on the left say it leans too far right and people on the right say it leans too far left. All that shows you is that it is one of the few colleges that has a near equal amount of each side of the political spectrum.,"UTD’s campus is very beautiful: incorporating modern architecture with nature. My parents graduated from this school about 25 years ago and it has improved a lot since then! The people there are also very kind. Although the AC is too low, that’s inevitable in America 🤷🏻‍♀️","Mediocre at best. Most of the professors don’t care about their students. Class sizes are huge. I’ve attended 3 institutions now, including this one. No school had general education requirements as useless as this one. I transferred after my first year. Don’t regret it at all",This was a great campus to go to. I went here on a field trip and it was the most beautiful campus. The scenery was nice and the buildings were clean and spacious. I highly recommend taking time to go see this university.,"I transferred from VA Tech and I really love this school. Sooo much better than Tech. The population is very diverse and have never seen racism or treatment of students unequally based upon age, gender, race. The wonderful professors truly CARE about your education and the business school is bomb. If you're looking for a good education with small classes and amazing professors, come here!! I wish they would stop raising the prices on parking though, it's getting obnoxious.",Don’t go there yet (hopefully I will) but I went on a tour and it was great. The two senior girls were detailed and answered some difficult questions (about birth control do to GTown being Catholic). The school was beautiful and the surrounding area was historic and really interesting,"Every fall, I am reminded as to why Iowa State University is ranked as one of the most beautiful campus in the country.  All the fall foliage makes me want to keep snapping photos like an incoming freshman visiting the campus for the first time.  Some of the best locations for looking at fall colors are: 1) around the campanile, 2) central campus (near Pearson Hall), and 3) along Osborn Dr.  If you want to avoid getting judged by others for taking pictures, there are plenty of photo opportunities at Reiman Gardens. However, be sure to take those photos quickly as peak fall colors only lasts for about a week.","The esteemed   Professor O'leary

Curriculum is challenging but something worth gaining doesn't come easy after all.

So proud to be apart of a preeminent university!,"Good God, where do I even start. Trying to get into this school is a nightmare. Save your time and money and go somewhere else if you can.","Applied for engineering, never received an acceptance email or letter but later when I checked the portal online it said ""expired offer of admission"". I contacted the school and they said it was too late. Don't rely on email/phone/mail (even if you supply all that information!).","As a current student at this school I am majoring in Secondary Education and I must say that the people at the Secondary Education department are fantastic. Since I've enrolled they have kept me on track to graduate, even after I had my child they sent me information on what I should do to graduate on time. The campus is clean and beautiful to look at. The graduate education classes are small and you have time to talk to your professors.","Great historical university. Second oldest chartered school in the country after Harvard. You can tour the restored Christopher Wren building, the original campus building. Walk the historic grounds. Also, a great school with many undergraduate and graduate degrees offered.","While most of the staff is great, as an employee you have absolutely no recourse or rights if you are mistreated.  Staff such as PIs and professors are allowed to mentally and psychologically abuse employees at will.  They can de facto demote you for nothing, despite all of the ""protections"" regarding changes to job duties.  HR says there is absolutely nothing they can do.

Do NOT work or study here.","We had a fantastic time at the Home Coming Bash 2018. The University  hired us once again  and the student went wild. They were so happy to see Caricatures by Tony Smith,  we were thrilled to be there. Fun times, lasting memories. Check out some of the faces i drew. 

Students are always cool. The event is a big deal at the University","Went here today to find a out that the disc golf course is now closed and defunct. I thought the campus was beautiful, it seems well organized, but it is massive. I did see some construction as others have mentioned, but it did not hinder traffic at all. This is a great place for a walk if you like to be surrounded by lots of people.","UPDATE:  this area has been cleaned up!  Way to go!  
I love the school itself, I love the security on the school grounds, directing traffic and all.  BUT.....if we want to be known for our beautiful and safe campus and encourage others to come to this university, something must be done about the homeless person(s) camping here. I see kids using their bikes down this street to get to school, and they have to pass through here.  If this person needs help, then he/she should be taken to get help, but it is embarrassing. At the front entrance, you will see a homeless man with a sign, and he retreats to his camp.  There is no way you cannot see it, and the funny thing is that a cop stops nearly everyday to stop speeding cars.  Now, no, you should not be speeding, but this person is literally adding more and more stuff here when it is illegal! And in the mean time lots and lots of students are paying lots of money to stay in the dorms.  They might as well just camp here too for free.","When I started attending here in 2003, MacLeans rated it the worst university in its category in Canada.  After taking a BSc and working here for eleven years, I can readily appreciate their point-of-view.  Like any university, it has its upsides and when I was young, the positive was all that I wanted to focus on.  But after swimming in the deep-end, I could see how horrid it all really was.","UMass Boston is a work in progress in any way you can imagine. After being here for two years, one can suffice to say it is an inadequate place to receive the best college experience. Although it has a nice ocean view, it is impossible to walk through this campus without hearing a self proclaimed “p.c.” person making prejudiced comments toward white people. I’m transferring this year to hopefully find a better college experience.","All my aunts and uncles attended school here- cousins, too. It was a kinder gentler time. The campus is busy and vast."

Close to Philly enough.just great","I stayed at the U of T dorms these past 2 summers after I lost both parents to cancer. The last two days I've been stuck with nowhere to go and this morning I stopped by 1 classic ave to use the washroom. I walked by the head of operations manager and said good morning and I just got ignored. Next thing I knew I had 2 cops there to talk to me because that woman had called the cops on me instead of saying good morning like a decent person would. I guess that's the treatment I get for spending thousands of dollars here when I didn't have much at all. I will never stay here again after this. That woman is completely heartless to do this to someone over using a ""public"" washroom.
She also stood there with a smile on her face and almost laughing while I was being spoken to. That's real professional coming from the head of operations.","One of my responsibilities while working for Intel Corporation was on-campus recruiting. Sometimes, this responsibility was very interesting meeting students who wanted to get started on their chosen field.

It’s a great tourist spot too since there are so many beautiful places inside the campus.","Amazing school! I recommend at least applying there :)
PS. Idek if I got in yet, but I like it already 😍😫","I did the campus tour on July 11th, 2018.  I absolutely loved this University.  The campus is unbelievably beautiful, but it is small too.  This University consists of around one thousand undergrad and one thousand five hundred grad students.  All of their tests are take home tests which students usually love.  This University is very reaserch heavy which brings tons of benefits to the students and finally there is a lot of collaboration between the students. I think this University is extremely nice and everyone should visit it if they can.","Had the opportunity to visit with my daughter last week. I have lived in NYC years ago and had false expectations of being overwhelmed by a university in the big apple. I was so wrong. Columbia University feels as if it's in it's own beautiful bubble in a quieter neighborhood all it's own with a great richness and diversity in it's student body and seemingly very happy, proud, comfortable students all around. Beautiful buildings, out of a movie, with a sincere feeling of really genuine people moving about campus.","Founded in 1865? Look how far we have fallen. 

from Campus Reform - 
Student ambassadors at Cornell University were given an “orientation packet” ahead of welcoming the incoming freshman class. The packet contains a sheet of categories labeling certain groups as having “privilege” or being “oppressed.”

Campus Reform obtained a copy of the document from a concerned student who felt the content was inappropriate. The sheet outlines social issues and designates certain demographics as privileged or oppressed in a “U.S. Context.” The 15 categories range from gender identity to martial/parental status, education level, and “use of English.”

According to the document, if you speak “accented English” you are marginalized or oppressed compared to “‘proper’ English” speakers who are privileged. If your parents are married or “in a heterosexual relationship” you are privileged while “divorced; LGBTQ parent; domestic partnership” and “single parent” individuals are oppressed.

Insanity. Just more proof that our universities have become nothing more than liberal indoctrination and brainwashing centers.","As a student at UT, all I have to say is that this school is the best. All staff and professors really care for everyone on campus. Also, safety for all is priority; UT police will come to the rescue soon. What starts at UT does changes the world.","The university is decent, but the town is worse. Mean and horrible townsfolk. Be better, Champaign!","NYU is probably not for you.

I was a little unsure since my whole life I was set on being far away from home - I am from durham, NC and my parents work in Raleigh so I was worried I wouldn't get the independent experience that comes with college - but this campus is like a small town and has it's own style that feels completely separate from Raleigh and the surrounding areas.

I spend 20 minutes at a time on phone calls and when they do finally pick up, they are unable to find someone who can help me, so they tell me they'll send me an email. When the email finally comes after many weeks, it's a copy-pasted generic email that doesn't answer my question. I decided to cancel my offer.

Lots of bikes.  Lots of food choices.  People on campus seemed genuinely happy.,"UIC is a University with 5 star professors and a -4 stars administration. Your first question when looking up the university should be the low graduation rate of 58% (2014) or the fact that students transfer OUT at a rate of almost 41% and this is due to the administration literally frustrating students into leaving with their bureaucracy and overall unwillingness to help students through the maze of logistics that they created (subsequently understanding it about as little as the students do). 

The buildings are all extremely old and are in the brutalist architectural style, which if you know what that is then you know the buildings are all modeled to look like prisons. 100% concrete with windows two inches wide. No, I'm not kidding. The buildings have been notoriously known to be depressing and confusing to navigate. Just adding to the overall atmosphere of hopelessness. 

The administration could not be worse. They're slow, unkind, unwilling, seemingly uncaring for students which is their entire job. It's as if they're all not being paid. When their students are literally paying to be there. Which is a disgusting attitude to cary both towards students and just in general as a professional. 
Their counselors are on a revolving door as they can never seem to hire any worth their salt and the administration doesn't care because they use them for themselves as scapegoats. If you see yourself having to deal with a dean or advisor at any point, just do the transfer papers instead. They're easier to get done than whatever it is you're going to them for. 

The professors are the polar opposite. They provide an above average education and are very accommodating. Helping students, with their very limited powers, wherever they can as they understand this sentiment about the administration and immediately empathize with the students when approached. 

Understand that this university provides a good education, but you better hope that the attending student doesn't ever have to deal with the administration as they will ultimately come away defeated, discouraged, and seeking alternate options (see graduation rate).",I graduated from this University.  It is one of the top ranked research institutions in the country.  Their pharmacy school is ranked second in the nation and believe me they deserve it. Excellent instructors and facilities.  You are treated with respect by your professors.  The campus is beautiful and the student body friendly.  Minneapolis has a reputation as the biggest small town you'll ever know.  Large metropolitan area but the people are friendly and down to earth.  I love this place.,I did my Master's here. It's one of the best schools in the country. I love it. Proud to be a Pitt alumni. #H2P,"Pro: Unmistakably a university. Many nice bricks. Has a piece of the Berlin Wall. I am told the libraries work properly. 
Con: Seems like it may be controlled by secret societies. No, really, there are too many of them and they leave sinister marks all over campus. No joke here.","I love this beautiful place - it is the most wonderful home away from home. My four years went by so fast! Get involved, go to games, get that degree!","[EDIT] changed from 2/5 to 3/5

Over 40% of the courses under the undergraduate course catalog (for electrical engineering) have not been offered since 2008. 400 lvl courses still feel too ""fundamental"" or ""introductory"" to the profession unless they offer lab sections or term projects with practical applications (which aren't many). I can't speak for all IPRO classes, but the two I took were kind of a joke. For a tech school, there seems to be a lack of accessible power outlets in many of the buildings, but they do have these huge beanbags which are great for powernaps. 

Most of the professors I had were amazing and very helpful. With that said, two were of little help and condescending. There's a very good amount of student resources. I especially liked the prototyping space in the IIT tower and the shop training sessions.  The current grad students said they're having a good time but a working professional (not at IIT) advised me not to go there for graduate studies.

[Edit 10.4.18] I'm nearing my graduation date and my overall impression of the school has not changed much. It's headed in the right direction but I feel is still lacking. For ECE majors, there is not a single PCB design class due to it being a liability apparently. circuit board design is probably one of  a the most basic and valuable skills one can a aquire and hardware design doesn't seem to be stressed as much. 

Advising sessions were not that helpful in my opinion and we were only allowed a few minutes with our advisors. I got more help from my professors and former students than from my advisor. The only reason we need to see them is for our class registration pin. I think they should give more of their time towards freshmen, transfer and foreign students who are new to the profession and need more guidance. 

Career fairs are good, but strangely scheduled a few days before midterms or exams. There are other opportunities to gain experience on campus such as robotics club and a couple other organizations, so that's cool too. School can only do so much, students should also show initiative by taking on independent projects or ask to work on a project (expect no payment).

Professors should consider taking students under their wing if they show diligence. What professors and grad students should NOT do is ask undergrads for help on a project and not offer some form of compensation. Higher education is expensive enough, asking an aspiring electrical engineer to work for free or offer to 'pay in experience' is borderline insulting.",Overall very good experience at Mac and wouldn't trade my undergrad experience for another if I could. Like anywhere I guess you'll have to deal with staff that make you wonder how they got hired but those instances were very minimal for me. Overall McMaster is a wonderful university with a beautiful campus!,Why can't we hate all bias professors? Maybe because they are not all so hateful and discriminating as others. The title professor doesn't mean what it used to.,Good institution. Some admin and advisors are just coasting on thier union jobs and do not seem to care about students,"We visited campus to attend an event at the Planetarium, as well as the Observatory. We had time to kill while waiting for the Planetarium to open so we rented bikes from a nearby kiosk and rode around campus. The campus is extremely clean and inviting, and is very bike friendly! It sits at the base of the mountain, so it is very picturesque.","I absolutely have loved being a part of the UF environment; however, there is a TREMENDOUS issue with the upper administration offices and their ability to keep everything organized and together. In one semester alone, I had to straighten out three HUGE mess ups on their part that impeded my ability to continue my classes. Just be warned when coming in, you will need to be extra diligent in looking over all of your transferred classes, your fees due (some classes didn't post their costs until two weeks before the end of the semester), and making sure that all of your required classes for your degree are still being offered. Good luck!!","Spent 5 years of my life here, and I'm going to miss it so much! My profs were all top-notch and created an awesome learning experience, and the student life is great if you put some effort into making the most of it. No school is without its shortcomings, but going to Western was still the best decision I've ever made :)","Applied to this university for next spring.
It has been more than 3 months now trying to contact one of their professors because i need a supervisor as part of the application. I have sent him several messages but no single reply.I have sent the university an Email more than a week ago but still no response.
I think that no body cares at this university.
This is a joke compared to how universities deal with future students here in the US.
I don’t know if this is how they deal with their future students and how competent they are.
This gave me the idea that if i study here, i will have many problems which are considered easy issues in other colleges.","For well over a decade, female students in Dartmouth's Department of Psychology and Brain Sciences have treated as sex objects by tenured professors","Really beautiful campus that makes me wish I went here. There's lots of grass and paths to walk on as well as lots of areas to just hangout. To put it simply, the campus is somewhere any student could find something they like and feel comfortable","My limited time here was pretty good. Professors were a mixed bag from not so good to amazingly engaging. As with any education, it's what you make of it. I made a lot of great friends in a short time and I think it's an excellent school. The campus is beautiful and many of the buildings are gorgeous.",I graduated from here in 1998 and had great memories about going to school there. The campus is beautiful and very nostalgic about the great friends I met there. Hope to go back and visit soon.  Wish I could go back in time and be a student again.,The best hospital i have ever been to the doctors and staff are really nice,Beautiful campus with all the traditional styled buildings. I really like the new Bauer hall which features a huge glass roof. I went to Sam Fox school to learn more about their Architecture programs. The staff and faculty there are super friendly and answered all my questions with passion.,"One day this skid mark on society will be shut down and all the scum that works here is gonna have an extremely hard time finding work.

Lets just say a fortune teller told me ;)

Good luck you filthbags.  More and more ""Go Bus"" situations are coming your way ;)",GWU is one of the best universities across the United States. They offer great degrees for social sciences. The only negative issue for me to mention is that they do not own a 'regular' university campus.,This is an okay school. I wouldn't recommend majoring  in chemical engineering because I have no idea what's going  on most of the time. But I would recommend getting to know Dhruv Patel. He's a great guy and makes all the pain of RPI go away.,"An institution in Syracuse, SU's magnificent grounds & old architecture makes for a wonderful place of historical exploration (& famous well known graduates) & visual eye candy, especially in the fall.

I always follow the Shamrock Series so I've seen the great Irish play in Boston & San Antonio.   Also seen them vs USC in Cali.   This year I said ""I'm going to the house Rockne built!""  Went to the Ball state & FSU games in South Bend this year and I must say It was the most awesome experience ever.   It's been on my bucket list for awhile and now I've seen 2 games at this historical site is a great feeling.

Lots if new construction.,Just tried to register here in they discriminate when they first see you like I can't afford to pay for a class do not go here at all racist people.,"Yes, tuition keeps on rising. Sitting in a major specific class with 200 students is awesome..... No associates degrees are awarded and on top of that transferring from this college is useless unless within the state of Utah. If you want your professor to help you, it's either via an email or grad student. Honestly I felt I had better class quality at Salt Lake Community College.",c/o 2001 best years were spent here. Highly recommend,"Love the campus, facilities and best of all, the academics. Its just getting better with time. Has a diversified student population and decent private housing near the university. Close to Washington DC and located in the heart of the 'pretty' Fairfax city which makes it accessible to some good places to hangout for the weekend. Bike-friendly campus. Very safe. Great infrastructure. Plenty of on-campus jobs. 

The fee being a bit pricey for non-residents is a con I see next to pricey car parking across the campus. A complaint many students share is some of their good courses are offered infrequently.","We took the prospective student tour and were very impressed. The senior who lead our tour was very well-spoken and told us a good deal about the curriculum, housing, clubs, sports, Greek life, and almost anything we could think of. We ended the tour near the bookstore, which was nice, as we then picked up some branded items. The tour was very helpful, and we definitely recommend taking it if you have anyone who's considering Georgetown.","Teachers clearly do not care about their students in the slightest, you are completely ignored or given brief responses from professors that basically say that helping you is tok much effort for them and you should have done more on your own.","Went to School of Business for an MBA.  Too many international students who speak English as a 3rd language (not even joking) - most write in English using Google translate.  Uninspiring classes because of it.  2 of 3 of my professors said they dumb down the material so that these students can actually understand.  The 2 stars are for the professors, because they will make time to give you individual attention. And they're really intelligent.","Met a few cool professors, but everything else is pretty terrible. Impenetrable groups of friends, NEED a car, cheating students (even at graduate level), bad books and lousy TA's, need to know people to get into extra programs. Transferred from a much better CC, was very disappointed.","Lovely campus.
Quite green and spacious.
Very friendly students, faculty and staff.
Very wide range of programmes available.
International students are well taken care of and would feel quite at home.
Top-notch facilities and infrastructure.","The staff here are slow, and have seemingly low problem solving skills. Admissions take forever because communication here is very poor. Do not recommend","I have had the unfortunate experience of meeting and sharing an entire election day (@a poll station)with a student of CARLETON.

Important to remember the commitment to providing access to higher education for so many over the years.  Very proud alumna.","The three years I spent at William and Mary were the best three years of my life.  My professors were passionate, caring, understanding, knowledgeable, and experienced.  My friends were exceptional and inspirational, while I was given so many opportunities to learn and grow.  I am especially indebted to the endless support I received from the Writing Center, the Career Center, the Counseling Center, Reves Center for International Studies, and the Student Engagement and Leadership Office, and can't wait to pay it forward.",The books are good but the people are better. Great place to study,"Worst school ever!!!!! If i could give this place negative 5 stars I sure would.  I would never advise anyone to go there under any circumstance. The financial aid staff is rude and in helpful (most of them), they’re only after your money, they purposely try to make you stay longer than you have to, and the out of state tuition is ridiculous. This school is not worth a single penny of mine.","I enjoy my days here for many different reasons - people, environment, working freedom and opportunities. It's an amazingly growing campus for good. 

The dedication of the university is reflected in many areas. Last year the football team became only undefeated college team in USA, the computer programming contest team became North America champion. These successes seems to be the beginning of many to come. It so exciting be here in such great going moments for the university.","For the most part, UH is nearly a top notch university. Like all other schools of it's caliber, it offers much more than an education which is very appealing to incoming freshmen. However, if said students practice the dedication required for completion, the extras are little more than additional debt to us.
Furthermore, the administration shows little concern for vistitors and students living off campus. Available parking is minimum and the cost is at premium. Any hope of attending class on days proceeding a home football game is lost for commuters.","The university was established 1877. University location ""Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada"". It is a public university. The university Motto "" Flourish (or prosper"". University Nickname ""Bisons"". University campus environment good. Good communication & transportation.","I'm currently a Sophomore at UMB and want to try and provide a completely honest, unbiased review of the school. 

I'll start off with pro's - most of the services staff seem to really care about their students. Everyone I've ever dealt with for any services I've needed has been incredibly helpful. My parents are retired so expendable income isn't rolling in, but UMass gave me a financial aid package that covered the year for me, on top of that, a $750 voucher to the bookstore. 

That's about where the pro's end. A lot of the teachers are underpaid, meaning staff is either upset or inexperienced. My computer science professor this year is literally a student instructor, teaching a major course. He's incredibly unclear and never responds to emails. Maybe this is due to the size of classes, but responding to emails seems to be a thing that just doesn't happen. Teachers encourage seeing them during their office hours, probably because they're so bored at their jobs otherwise. That seems to be the only way to reach out to them, but only because it's convenient for them. 

On top of that, there really isn't any effort to get to know the students. I am a sophomore, and only two teachers so far in my time here have bothered to learn our names. This is understandable if you're at a lecture, but even the small classes don't really have any sense of one-to-one with your professor. 

Not helping this is the students who attend the school; for some reason, everyone here is incredibly awkward, sometimes rude, or just outright not worth spending your time with. Students here are either (understandably) shy international students, students who attend because they need to (not because they want to), and students who work full time on top of going to school. This creates an environment where kids show up, go to class, then immediately go home without talking to anyone. Even most of the upperclassmen travel around on their own. I consider myself a pretty social person, and haven't made one friend here. It's not that making friends is difficult, it's damn near impossible. 

Parking is bad and expensive to boot, the construction on campus is awful, the atmosphere is depressing especially in the winter, it's freezing most of the time considering it's on the water, the school was originally designed to be a prison so there are no windows in classrooms and the politics based around money and the UMass system's neglect of the Boston campus means I can't recommend this school to anyone. I'm anxiously awaiting December break so that I can transfer and never look back. 

UMass Boston has the competence and composure of a community college, but expects a workload out of its students that reflects a high-ranking university. I'd stay away - you're better off going to a community college and transferring from there. I made the mistake of thinking this was an affordable college experience - there is no college experience, and the experience it's given me has been awful and disheartening.","The University of New Mexico is a unique place to attend college. With a mix of diverse student body and a variety of degree programs in Art, Science, and Medicine, this university has opportunity for any student eager to obtain their degree. The university has a very active student body, and I found interest in several clubs. One of which being the UNM Mountaineering Club which focuses on taking students outdoors without breaking their budget (as they pay for mostly everything!). The campus is located around a variety of great restaurants and coffee shops which are great places to unwind, and finish homework. The campus has a beautiful aesthetic and is very safe to walk through. I have had a great experience here and have met so many influential and kind people, some of which are now very close friends of mine. Go Lobos!"

The mission of MIT is to advance knowledge and educate students in science, technology, and other areas of scholarship that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century.

The Institute is committed to generating, disseminating, and preserving knowledge, and to working with others to bring this knowledge to bear on the world’s great challenges. MIT is dedicated to providing its students with an education that combines rigorous academic study and the excitement of discovery with the support and intellectual stimulation of a diverse campus community. We seek to develop in each member of the MIT community the ability and passion to work wisely, creatively, and effectively for the betterment of humankind.

Across our five schools, MIT faculty help set the global standard of excellence in their disciplines: They are pioneering scholars who love to teach. Deeply engaged in practice, they topple conventional walls between fields in the push for deeper understanding and fresh ideas. In fact, many faculty actively work in at least one of MIT’s interdisciplinary labs, centers, initiatives, and institutes that target crucial challenges, from clean energy (opens in new window) to cancer .

The five Schools are 

School of Architecture and Planning 
School of Engineering 
School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences 
MIT Sloan School of Management 
School of Science","Amazing!!! First thing, its a lot of walking, consider a bike for sure. I want to go back soon and see more that I missed. I took so many photos because it was so beautiful. I really enjoyed the scenary, the people, the buildings, and the weather. My favorite was the older buildings, bull of history. The newer buildings are amazing as well. Awesome Campus!",Great tour by Alexander - his passion for the Drama/Theater/Design program shined throughout his presentation.  Gave realistic statistics at the end of the tour and a great Q & A session.,I'm just saying that this place is the best place to set up a future. The people and the atmosphere is just lovable. I wish I could be able to get back there one day!,I rate this 5 start for the great things I've always heard about Harvard. I hope to benefit from this great epitome of knowledge. Even if just for 2 years. Hoping for the best.,It just feels like old age. The architecture is old style. Its worth visiting. The chapel and the muesum specially. The parking is on the street. Visit in the day light. The chapel is worth visiting.,"Good school located downtown Toronto. Lots of resources, and the professors/teacher advisers/staff were helpful. Tuition fee was quite expensive. A good place overall to study and live. I am a new student coming in for first year :)","Here Jim Morrison, who moved from Florida, attended the experimental cinematography center and took his degree.
In the same years he attended the school also the future keyboardist of the band, Ray Daniel Manzarek, with whom Morrison made friends.

This place was also the location of the movie ""nightmare 3"" for the external shots of the psychiatric hospital.","The top of the University in the world. There are so many classic buildings and stories. Go for a walk and take a picture of the campus, so nice.","Sometimes this school is pretty good, sometimes its hot garbage.  There are days where I say ""Georgia Tech is such a wonderful school. I'm so glad I got here."" Other days I just wish this school doesn't exist.  Sometimes the websites don't work and links to various sites are down, which is alright for a regular school.  But for a school dedicated to technology (hence the institute of TECHNOLOGY) it can be very annoying, especially when the professors like to have homework posted on said websites.  There are times where the work is unnecessarily hard.  Giving students advanced problems on brand new material can be a good way to introduce a subject and challenge the mind.  But doing it for the sake of being difficult and keeping a reputation is rather bothersome.  Sometimes I like to compare this school to an ex lover.  An ex lover who you know is bad for you, but you keep hoping that someday in the end it'll be worth it.  And you keep telling yourself ""just one more semester"" and many times you will be rewarded for your hard work.  More often than not though, you will be disappointed.  If you're a straight A+ student and have never failed in your life before, I recommend coming here. Only because I to see the reaction to the inevitable failure.  This school is hot dog doo doo. 4/5 would recommend.",Lovely place to go around. Lot of things to see. I truly recommend it to visit and spend there a whole day.,This University is very interesting in the way that they like to segregate people and show preference based on skin color and sexual orientation. What happened to teaching and letting people be free to show what they are made of on the inside and not the outside appearance that they were born with? It's sad.,"The campus is enormous and beautiful, there's literally a 40,000 acre forest within the school, a farm and hospital for the vet majors, literally a designated section for each major. The students and staff give off a really sophisticated but friendly vibe. The campus is pretty diverse, though a large portion is Asians and white. They also have their own art museum and natural history museum free to the public. There's 5 gyms on campus too.","Have had several visits here with my child who plans on attending soon.  LOVE the staff, hospitality and friendliness of all involved. First class school with a wonderful campus and a tremendous staff. Update, my daughter is attending UT now and LOVES it. Moooooove in day was a headache, however this school is really second to NONE!!!",I loved my time here as a student. The town is good and the student life is nice as well for the size of the city.,"As an Alumni, I have a special place in my heart for NYU. This is a great school for students that are looking for a top-notch education in a city environment. The campus is definitely a city setting. When you step out of your dorm or classroom buildings, you are on the streets of NYC.","The most beautiful school campus in BC! I spent 4 years getting my undergrad here and they were made pleasant by the gorgeous museums and gardens, modern vs old architecture and the natural scenery surrounding each academic building. Students receive free admission to all these wonderful places on campus and there are so many things to explore!",I no longer work at Penn. Working there was a great experience and prepared me for my next job. The fellow who said you need to know someone there to get hired doesn't know what they are talking about. I'm a minority and I got hired without knowing a danged soul.,"YC / MC 2003.  Every student should attend college in an environment where they can excel.  No one school is a perfect fit for everyone, but Yale was a perfect fit for me.  I had a great time learning from the other students around me.  It broadened my perspectives and really helped me to see the world from other points of view.  It was an amazing learning experience in an environment like no other.  

Yale is a lifelong experience.  Alumni organizations and networking opportunities continue to play a role years after graduation.  In fact, I have had support from Yale in overcoming a recent hurdle in my career path.  My law school, Washington University in St. Louis, told me to seek assistance elsewhere; Yale has offered support, networking, and resume advice.  

There are people that hold animosity toward Yale out of resentment or blind ignorance, but I have been impressed by every graduate I have met so far.  I highly recommend this institution for anyone who has a passion for learning and feels connected to the community that exists on campus.","A wonderful environment to spend a day, even if you are not a student at UCSD. There is incredible architecture all around (hop on a campus tour if one is leaving soon). There are plenty of places to lounge around - indoor or outdoor. Make sure you visit Geisel library, great building and you want a pic with Dr. Seuss. Relive your youth here. :)","In the first place, Michigan remains a top-rated public university. It has many stellar departments, and your degree will open doors anywhere from social work to engineering to medicine. When I was there, the campus was nice and spacious. There are also many extra-curricular opportunities  including football, Greek life and volunteering. However, Michigan is not for everyone. If you like a more intimate, hometown college feel, you may not prefer this school. On the other hand, if you are a self-starter and a second-generation college student, you will do fine. 
 Navigating U of M's serpentine class scheduling and financial aid systems as a first-generation college student would have been a nightmare. As an out-of-state student, I regret not seeking more grants and scholarships, otherwise I had a great experience at U of M.","Be aware if you are sending your kid here.
The school and faculty has been infiltrated by anarchists and marxists. 
Already some professors like Mr. Moore are quitting because no one wants to work in a toxic and authoritarian environment.","Couldn't have picked a better place to spend my next four years. After only 2 months, Boston University already feels like home. Academics are extremely rigorous, which can be painful, but the results are worth it. There's never a shortage of student activities to do. Dining and residence on campus tend to be a joke among students, but we have it far better than many other universities; I love eating on campus and living in my dorm. Best of all, I meet new people every day who are incredibly open-minded and diverse. There's a reason I became a BU ambassador!",When it come to Basketball!! This is the best team hands down!! Employers hire 90 percent of Duke students!! Under cover millionaires graduate from this school!!!,A great walkable or bike riding area,"This is part of Montreal walking tour that I personally designed for myself to get acquainted with everything in Montreal. McGill is Harvard of Canada and ranked from the top 20 universities worldwide. The campus is amazing and may be deemed as part of your sightseeing.  I strongly recommend that you do walk in the campus. Next to the campus, Saint Catherine St which is a major high street in Montreal. Take advantage of this.","The Penn State online program or World Campus is a money-making, love-less program. Online programs are highly lucrative endeavors for universities, maximize the number of students per class to get more $$$. The Master's of Education in Children's Literature at Penn State stands out as a program in which students in general are not remembered by their professors and are just nameless tuition payers who receive grades. It's really sad as this is potentially such a unique program - I wish I would have known this before I began. The program doesn't care about their students or their names - just the tuition dollars. I switched to a different distance/online master's program and my experience is really different - the professors know who I am and actually are innovative problem-solvers who are willing to support student's learning. Sometimes the more prestigious programs like Penn State actually are less value - lesson learned. The professors/instructors at the Penn State online program are so overloaded they just don't care - students are just a random names on a computer screen. It was a really disappointing experience with Penn State. They charge a steep tuition, provide assignments impersonally online, and then deliver a diploma. No care or support. I advise talking over the phone or skype with the program coordinator or a professor of online masters program  (not just email) to get a better feel for the program before beginning.","Amazing yearly tuition fees for the ratings in engineering, medicine, agriculture, and business. However Purdue is a dying breed for overall higher education. There are so many online resources now and many young kids are discovering they don't need a big university. If I could talk to my 18 year old self, I'd tell myself to become a mechanic or electrician! I can't learn that stuff online, they pay super well, and don't bring on massive debt - there are a lot of majors offered that anyone can go online and learn for free.... I graduated in 2011 with a degree in financial planning and consulting. Looking back, I spent over $50,000 and definitely didn't get my money's worth. Purdue doesn't care about its alumni unless they throw $10million for a campus building. For me, a lot of my attitude of Purdue comes from the classrooms. The majority of professors were well below Purdue's advertising hype suggests. I had a teacher randomly assign grades to fit the bell curve. He was a complete joke yet taught two of my investment classes. Another teacher, a Dr. Snuggs was also a total waste of time, tuition, and emphasized exact formatting on papers instead of actually learning material. She taught both International Marketing and my Business Ethics class. All of us in those classes quickly figured out we would be doing more teaching than the professor. Besides a few choice words about growing up African American in the deep South, Dr. Snuggs spent a lot of time reading demographic information to us and maintaining an environment filled with her negative stern attitude. These are just two examples (out of about 10 of my classes) that picture Purdue more of an aspiring low class college instead of an internationally recognized university for research and education. On balance, many of my friends have had and current are having a much better experience at Purdue. But they are taking advantage Purdue's better equipped majors like technology, science, and ag. I present these two opposite images of Purdue: you can really think if this is the school for you. Be smart and go for the majors Purdue is recognized for or look for better options! Take caution if you're not that keen on what you want to do. A trade school is going to be the smart choice for many people who think they need to go to a big state university.",It was the best of times. I completed my Masters of Arts in Teaching graduate program at this fine university.,Very friendly people and a serious but comfortable university atmosphere.,"Some of the faculty here are we Todd did, sofa king we Todd did to think they are smart and have valid points. They are close minded and only care about money.","Great city, great people, great campus. The flagship university of Wisconsin is everything you want in a public university. World recognized academics and research facilities and athletics that constantly tank nationally. The university is surrounded by lakes and bike routes and arboretums.",You can create your own concentration here!,"The campus is open to anyone, with tons of activity and great beach spots. The bike path along the coast is always busy but has some new developments happening. The campus itself is clean and large, with tons of lounges and places to eat.",great research program and attentive staff,"I live in Renfrew Arms Apartments on 98 ave & 104 street 4+ years, students from here like Jessica (business/yoga) & Jenna (aucupuncture) by city of edmonton and their gangs regularly (24/7) wirelessly shocking and torturing teanants in of renfrew and britania. need help. They bring in hundreds of cars and target individual teanants through 'the horizon apartments' + 'the palisades/broadwalk' + vincity. need help. Sometimes they put digital image of other people's heart and palpitate and burst vulnerable teanant's hearts. need help.","The school takes to many students  that they are not able to accommodate and it take so long to process your transcript, even after updating transcripts it still not correct. They  also want to give equal priority to new students instead to everyone who attends. uc Davis deserves zero stars it overhyped and  understaffed garbage school. Jammed pack office hours with ta and professors who give you no time to help you on a assignments because they only want to attend to  students who they feel will do well.professors are very discouraging to black student i  probably had one that I truly felt cared about seeing me do well despite there lies of saying that want to see me suceed. Professors told me that I can't pass a class despite the grade saying that I could still pass with a grade of atleast 66 but instead gave 40 grades. Had the same professors say I need to be in remedial writing class for non native English speakers. Also if you are black student be very very very cautious of your work because there are  white teacher assistant who are the majority in most department here  that will  single you out  for plagiarism and they  feel this entitlement because   it easy for them to do it because your  the only black person in the majority of your classes and sometimes they grade on your plagiarism rather than focusing on content and then report you unexpectedly even when you think everything fine at the end. I had a professor literally after break report me for plagiarism for an exam that was done two weeks before break that was perfectly fine when It was handed back to me and the shady part was that  I emailed him and he gave me the go ahead point to have me pass since it was pass no pass .In my 12 years of education I haven't had any problem with playgarism till I came here This school is for Berkeley rejects so if you don't get into ucb or ucla this is the perfect school for you. Don't let the good reviews fool you that UC Davis is a good school  because it totally the opposite . The people who have done well at this school are the students  who have access to past exams that proffesors end up using the the next quarter and then when they get a good grade they  claim that uc davis is on par with berkeley our ucla which it is not the case at all. The point of college is to learn on your own  I am really disappointed with the academics here at davis. . I wish i had stayed at  my community college longer and then transfer to uc Berkeley our UCLA . Since i been here i have not gotten a single good grade so far despite the effort that i put in . I lost my acceptance to UCLA because of this terrible school. My best grades have come from uc Berkeley  summer courses and  I will most likely finish all of my elective  requirement  next spring   summer and fall  at UC Berkeley. My advice to prospective students is to stay away from this uc at all cost if your doing social sciences, choose Berkeley instead you wont regret it. Berkeley  offers  45  upper division classes that are 5 units with a wide range of professors who have been teaching for 40years compare that to UC Davis 15 classes  with the same professor who teaches 15 classes our a professor who probably is just coming as a adjunct proffesor for a quarter . so if you end up with a bad professor at uc Davis your screwed . i given this school a chance since transferring in 2016 and it fallen my expectation of what a uc  education is suppose to look like as a non science major. Uc Davis spend a million  dollars  this year alone on a new scoreboard for there subpar football team  instead of filling the sociology department with more upper division professors who can teach more than just 18 classes and the fact that they used are tuition money to hide the pepper spray incident. Also it takes a super duper long time for the school to update your record. Most of the student workers also dont know what they are doing","The quote ""UMass Amhert has Great Chemistry"" says it all! I love the installations, the university provides the students with everything necessary to their succes. Food here is also excellent",Indelible and exquisite undergrad experience.,Best decision I ever made was going to ASU. Graduated in 08 and my life took off from there. Will always be grateful and love this university.,Such an amazing school with a relatively large beautiful campus! Indiana university and especially Kelly school of business is ranked number 1 in the entrepreneurial field of studies. Indiana offers hundreds of academic programs across multiple campuses and online.,"Great school. I met some excellent people and had some incredible experiences. Took a few classes that were unnecessary, but overall had a solid time.","Quality school with a beautiful campus. The sporting events are top class — football, basketball, baseball etc! The academics are quality as well, with great programs in engineering, agriculture, statistics and many more. Top of the line research is done here. The campus is also beautiful. Check out the Brickyard and the Court of Carolinas. The wolf ears by the brickyard is a cool thing to try as well. You can sit in them and hear the other person whispering across the field!","All these Haters leaving these erroneous reviews. Get a life, LOSERS. The most awesome place in the world.  Go Bucks.",My son attends and he is incredibly happy.,"neat place with open and somewhat noble atmosphere. The first fun thing is that on one of the aisle around it there planted some vege as tomatoes and pepper.  

The study room and canteen is also clean and tidy. A entertaining newspaper of rice is run by students since around 1916.

I like the buildings as they are designed to be mostly connected by pathway with roof. Thus my shoes are not going to wet during rainy days (I need to find the shoes that are both air pemeating and water proof ).","I loved this school as a student, highly recommended! One of the best educational opportunities that you can receive.","A great university with strong business program. Located on the top of Burnaby mountain, which provides the perfect location for higher level education. Plus, it has more snow days which may cause cancellation of classes, a bonus for some students, I’m sure. It also has a strong co-op program to help students gain some practical experiences before their graduation. 

I personally did the co-op program before my graduation, 4 terms of it, a little extreme, but it helped pay for my tuition fees, which is not getting any cheaper, and I believe the experience(Accounting and Internal Audit) also helped me to obtained the job offer right after my graduation (I had 1 week off after my graduation before starting my full time job as an accountant, which I kind of regret a little now, lol). 

I wish the sky train could connect from production way station to the campus though, but the bus run is frequent enough. There’s plenty of developments around campus now which provides convenient rental units for students, enable them to walk to school, although price is not cheap. There are plenty of restaurants on the east side of the campus. The parking is a lottery system, and there are a lot of people fighting for it.

Overall, a great school, and I’m a proud graduate from SFU.",Just read how this university treats any poor defenceless animal thats unlucky enough to end up here.   No feelings or empthy for the poor creatures and nobody regulating these sadists either.,"Many years ago, the National Paralympic Games were held on the campus of University of California, Santa Barbara. I participated in the track and swimming events. The games were a lot of fun spending time with friends on a very beautiful campus.",Love this university. Has a lot of cool things and professors are great.,I just got a mini tour of one side of this huge campus. The rooms are so comfy for a uni. Tiny kitchen and a bathroom you share with another person if you're in a single. Really nice.,"Hello, I do not attend this school but my father has (attended cmu too). Once I graduate of highschool I will be pursuing my dreams and trying to attend to this school! Good luck and have fun!","Pretty nice campus, but I can't speak to the academics.","Save your money if you’re out of state. They treat you like a second-class citizen. They are not attentive to any issues or request. Totally nonresponsive and apathetic! Save your money!  My son got attacked in the area and the school didn’t help at all!!!
. Beware,  check the police record of incidents/assaults in the area!","Don't expect any of your credits to transfer into this school. I was almost done with my Associates when life made me have to move. I chose IIT as the school I wanted to transfer to, of my 36 gen Ed credits, they took none. My 12 degree specific, they took none. Screw this place.","Terrible university. They take ages to analyze your submitted documents and finally give you a stupid reason to reject you, such as your school grades, even if you have a very high final exam average.","Beautiful, lively campus buzzing with eateries and coffee shops",Awesome university with all departments and located in awesome city and surrounding,"I went to CU for grad school and CSU for undergrad. The difference between them is night and day. Seriously - take a day and tour each campus. I'll be amazed if CSU doesn't feel more welcoming, vital, and interesting to you (and/or your children). Some good things happen at CU academically, but they happen in spite of the administration and the toxic environment on campus, not because of it. Avoid.",The small animal hospital is stunning! Love the Oncology Dept and all they do. Was there with Lap of Love veterinary hospice and they were so compassionate!  #gators,"After last nights’ display of frosh week echoing across the city I would give this facility zero stars if I could. I’ve officially lost all respect for their organization. 

In addition, through personal experience, I fully support the “unprofessional” reviews on here. I will spare the lengthy details but have seen better run programs and more supportive professors elsewhere.","Unless you are studying engineering, business, or some kind of computer science, realize that the degree that you obtain will be completely useless. The majority of the degrees obtained at this university are not recognized as being part of any professional order province-wide nor nation-wide. They are simply beta versions of better degrees. For example, instead of social work, they have human relations, instead of physiotherapy, they have exercise science, their urban planning degree doesn't qualify you to be an urban planner anywhere in Canada. See what I'm getting at? Make sure that you know exactly what your degree will qualify you for ahead of time. Otherwise, you will waste at least three years of your life studying something you thought would get you somewhere, only to realize that you shouldve been spending your time studying towards a real degree.","I loved the University Campus and Town. It's a classic Ivy League campus and town. You just feel like you could learn something on every corner. The campus is amazing. Nostalgia abounds, even though you didn't attend the university.","One of the best places that I got my education from! My professors were so nice and respectful. My personal major was history, I learned a lot.. recommended....",I am a graduate of this university and I am very very displeased that my library account was deactivated last week after almost 2 years of having access post graduation. This is very disappointing as I have an alumni card but this institution does not foster additional academics after graduation. Terrible ethics. Graduates of all levels should still have access to the online collection in addition to the physical books. Why can I take a book out but not look at an article? Shame to have given this place so much of my hard earned money.,Busy and productive day... Wow! Trees still having their green leaves and berries at this time of the season?,I feel sorry for you if you are a Postmate doing a drop off here in this general area because it always leads you in all sorts of crazy places far from the actual drop off and the customers (or the ones I've dealt with) never give you a description ON HOW TO FIND THEM ITS ABSOLUTELY MADDENING IM GOING TO SCREAM IF I GET ANOTHER DROPOFF HERE.,"not advisable at all for working professional for further advancement. Talked with program manager, realized no lab facility for the new program. the question like ""where you from originally"" is NOT expected from program manager. Program Director(He Claimed worked for govt Organization) need to take lessons of laws and US Constitution. The question indicate lots of bad about the university's policy from many perspective.","Ok, we heard a lot about the strike and we all know how detrimental that is. I just want to add a few things. First, the mandatory courses schedule only at 8:30am are really not practical especially during wintertime. Second, 4-hour-long classes are terrific because nobody can concentrate that long even with the break.","While the food was descent, the service was so so. Once the cashier finally paid attention to us and we were able to order, she was very friendly. But prior to taking our order, she continued to talk to another employee and chat about non work stuff and ignore customers. The sweet potato fries and grasshopper shake were very good.","Strong engineering school. High-quality and tough education.

0010110 Paul Dr. Paul McNeil ","Great school with the beautiful views  of Campus. The golden Dome was magnificent and located in the middle of School campus. Right next to it just yards away there was a basilica where they have masses for students daily where students could find their inner peace during the trouble times or just came in for the prayers. Behind the church you could find a river that connected to St Joseph ‘s river that ran along side of streets in Southbend. This campus was so big compared to other school in the Area . Sports here were outstanding and popular. The fighting Iris football team was the most admired and its popularity around the nation and locals here. The faculty’s members , and students here were very humbled and courteous.",My new home now 😅 love this place,Smart kids here making America great again.,"I see a lot of reviews saying this school has a beautiful campus and amazing reputation, which it does. Also, the professors are amazing and the students are very bright. However, the administration and politics within this university is abysmal. 

Little to no information was given regarding registration for after being accepted into the university for graduate students. When I called and emailed the school, I was transferred numerous times to numerous departments because nobody knew how to answer my question or who could answer it. There seems to be little to no communication between administration within the department. 

Parking doesn’t exist between 10am-3pm. With how much the cost of Parking, housing, and tuition has increased over the years, I expected improvements in the facilities and organiatoon within this university. I have seen little to no change within this university. 

Student life is also quite mundane. The university clearly does not strive to encourage an active and engaged student body. The university’s events such as weeks of welcome and guest speakers pale in comparison to every other university in Texas. This includes universities such as UT San Antonio and Texas State, which are significantly cheaper and smaller. Considering UTD’s notoriety for having the 4th most unhappy student body among universities in the country, I’m surprised the administration can turn a blind eye to student engagement. 

I feel like I’m just a dollar sign to this university after 4 years as an undergrad and 1 year as a masters student. I would not encourage anyone to come here.",Great college. Small class sizes in major and great tuition rates for a 4 year school with a good reputation,I worked at the FSU stadium 9/23/2012. Seminoles .vs. Clemson Tigers. All in all it was GREAT. I believe SEMINOLES won.,"Mason is very diverse, which is pretty much the major crowning achievement it has as a university. Tons if international students, the Mason LIFE program, etc. They allow a lot of individuals to have an inclusive college experience.

However, there is little school spirit among the students, and many 
 departments are incredibly disjointed and disorganized. There's a phenomenon at this university called the ""Mason Shuffle"" where someone will get passed from department to department, office to office, just to have one simple question answered, form signed, etc. As someone who used to be employed here, I can say that this doesn't affect students, but also staff members. The university grew so fast, but its infrastructure didn't quite grow to the same level, and as a result it's hard to get essential things done.

It's still largely a commuter school, which is great for locals who want to live at home and not have to pay for an [expensive] room on campus, but this further contributes to the feeling of the lack of community on campus.

Mason talks about how they're right up there with Virginia Tech and UVA, but they still have a very long way to go to be at the same level of academia and recognition. They frequently tout that they made the Final Four for the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament...in 2006! Over a decade ago! If that isn't living off old glory I don't know what is.",We went here for a quick tour and was amazed with the university's beautiful and peaceful environment.,Great game day atmosphere.

They have the worst communication. Trying to start school for the fall and applied 3 month in advance and something else alsways comes up that you need. Once you submit it take 3 weeks for them to review!!! Wasted $40 application for what? To be told you can't start school because we need this..... And then you turn it in and something else is mussmis! Never on the same page. They just want your damn money!","This university is gorgeous, the green areas, the lakes, the roads. All very impressive. The cafeterias are really clean and their food is good.","I am so impressed by the growth and progress of this school. Dining hall alone, it was marvelous! Now, I love to see more academic development. Go Cougar!",my experience at this place has left me neutral. Not the experience I had hoped for at a place of higher learning .,"Amazing university, makes you feel welcome no matter what's your color, background, or beliefs. They make you feel valued and warmly welcomed, such a happy comfortable environment and have exceptional professors!","Hate going to class everyday? Love cheap tuition with basic education? Say no more because this schools' just for you! At this university, you can BS every class assignment and still graduate on time! And why try to be an a**hole when graduates students here are top of the line arrogant and snooty! This deal also comes with students who also cheat their way to the finish line! 

Enroll today and receive the administration department package, it's ran by the students and even though they're not well trained, we still give them the attention they need because it's the only way your gonna get that mandatory hold off your student account. If you hate that, then you'll like attending required workshops that waste hours of your time, don't wanna go? here's another hold in case you do. Wait, enroll in the 10 seconds and get the awful student bonus! Like a jar of acid dissolving a box, the students here have rude attitudes and acrid personalities that will do the same! You'll notice it so much that even your politeness just melts away!

Average and sour students, bureaucratic administration, it's all here for you today!"
3,"In 1859, a proposal was submitted to the Massachusetts General Court to use newly filled lands in Back Bay, Boston for a ""Conservatory of Art and Science"", but the proposal failed.]A charter for the incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed by William Barton Rogers, was signed by the governor of Massachusetts on April 10, 1861.

Rogers, a professor from the University of Virginia, wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances.He did not wish to found a professional school, but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education, proposing that:

The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.","Beautiful campus that exudes charm with buildings that mix both modern and early 1900 architecture. While the campus itself, is busy with tourists, students, and faculty/staff roaming about, there is still a sense of peace and tranquility as you walk (or bike) from one destination to the other. 

Stanford truly is a top notch University specializing in academics, sports, and medicine, not just in the U.S., but in the world.","Fantastic University!
One of the top ranked universities in the United States, especially in Computer science and Robotics. 
Also one of the most expensive universities!
The campus is decent. 
The location is pretty good. It is very well connected to almost all the locations of the city due to its central location.","Best decision of my life to go here. I got a fantastic education at a reasonable price & made lifelong friends. Almost everyone you meet here is impressive, going places or doing something meaningful with their lives. If you are a nerd at heart, feel like other people don't get you, love to read, or build things, or to think deeply about ideas, these are your people. Leave your ego at the door and be open to joining extracurriculars, and you will have an amazing experience like I did. BS '13",Going to Harvard even as a student that doesn't go there was enjoyable. I recommend it for tourists that want togo there because of the amazing artifacts they have there. They also have some games to play for anyone for example foosball and table tennis.,"As a kid I used to walk here a lot, and I still do now that I'm older. They have wonderful scenery and the fountain there is beautiful. A lot of events are held here. Especially market day every Thursday. There are a lot of food selections there too so it's easy to find food.","I cherish the moments from my old University, and I wish I was still young enough to be able to go back.","My choice to do the Academic Intensive English Program at UCLA could not have been better. The classes are intense, dynamic and very productive, with excellent day-to-day as well as academic topics that have helped me a lot to improve my English in speaking, reading, and especially writing. The opportunity to live with students from different countries and exchange knowledge helps us to become citizens of the world with respect and understanding of different cultures and habits. Studying at UCLA was an incredible and excellent experience for my goals. I recommend to anyone who wants to study and learn English at an advanced level.","As an alumnus of the University of Washington, I can easily say this was the best university experience for me. I loved everything from student housing to all my professor in the MBA program. Wish I still live in Seattle, but work and additional collegiate studies took me away.",Smart ppl and nice view!,"Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910 and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán.[12][13] The university is one among a small group of institutes of technology in the United Stateswhich is primarily devoted to the instruction of pure and applied sciences.

Caltech has six academic divisions with strong emphasis on science and engineering, managing $332 million in 2011 in sponsored research.[14] Its 124-acre (50 ha) primary campus is located approximately 11 mi (18 km) northeast of downtown Los Angeles. First-year students are required to live on campus and 95% of undergraduates remain in the on-campus House System at Caltech. Although Caltech has a strong tradition of practical jokes and pranks,[15] student life is governed by an honor code which allows faculty to assign take-home examinations. The Caltech Beavers compete in 13 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division III's Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.",Thanks for educating my brilliant niece. She loved grad school at Columbia after a terrific undergraduate experience at Duke University!,The campus was really nice.  Also the Harry Potter themed library.,"Proud to have earned my PhD at UT Austin, and in 2012, named a Distinguished Graduate of the Community College Leadership Program. Great school, high quality academic rigor. Excellent faculty, staff, students, curriculum, support and facilities. I highly recommend UT to future scholars. Hook em' Horns!",Pretty impressive campus.,"NYU is an excellent place to get an education. Located in the heart of NYC, the greatest city in the world by far in my opinion, makes it especially desirable. The campus is surrounded by every type of business imaginable. Easy access to the Subway system places the entire city at your feet. The University undergraduate, graduate programs, offer an extensive amount of specialties. My son went to their graduate program and said the professors were engaging and phenomenally bright. Washington Square Park is vibrant. Nightlife is truly amazing. It is the city that never sleeps after all. The school is rather expensive, but the professors and location make it all worth while. It isn't difficult to see why so many dream of getting accepted to NYU.","An interesting collection of spiecemens and some displays.   Interesting to walk around and there's a interactive room in the back for a more close up view.  

It's a little dark and passive for those bringing kids, the little ones might eventually get scared or bored after a long visit.   Otherwise, it's an interesting place to go at least once",AFFORDABLE AND AWESOME STAFF . THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.,"Beautiful campus, enjoyable to walk around the city. One can get something to eat from the many choices available and have a picnic at Yale Cross Campus. Always inspirational.","Good faculty for the most part. The most unbiased are in the Political Science department if you can believe that. Professors outside of that department tend to show their biases more often. If you come here as a conservative, you WILL have your views challenged, which is important for personal growth. If you come here as a liberal, you will probably never have your views challenged, and you will end up being triggered into a psychotic episode when you get back to the real world. Advice for liberal-minded students looking to attend classes here: Search out conservative students and befriend them. 

Anyway, the education system in CA is a racket. Get everything you can out of them, and pinch your pennies. 

Oh, and the morons sent my degree through the USPS. It was bent when it got to me. I almost puked when I saw Jerry Brown's signature on the degree as well. 

Good riddance, CA. My home state is a liberal cesspool bent on penalizing the productive and paying the lazy a basic income so they keep voting because the poor outnumber the middle and upper class. Nothing says ""vote for me"" like free stuff. Does it FEEL good? Probably. Does it DO good? probably not.","The one and only reason I transfered to U of M was because at least 2 or 3 of their financial aid Representatives LIED TO ME telling me that my tuition would be free because I was eligable for the ""Go Blue Guarantee"". After starting classes they we're about to charge me late fees for not paying my tuition so I asked the financial aid representatives about it and they said if I payed my tuition they would refund it back to me when they finish processing my paperwork which never happened. After paying my tuition they told me I was not eligible for the go Blue guarantee so I was never refunded my tuition. When I called to complain they denied the entire situation.

By the way, in my experience taking 60+ credits between two Universities and a community college the only significant difference between a University and a community colleges is the price.",It's in South Central so it's pretty ghetto once you take a step outside. Don't let the pamphlet fool you.,"Beautiful and the tour to see the university was excellent and the presentation was the best in compere with others that I saw before, very organized and go to the most important point to be admitted.",Great college I know,Best physician talent and resources reside here!,Great Place for everyone. You have one of the best university of Canada in front of you.,The campus is very beautiful in a nice small city.,"I was really contemplating on going to this school. However, they kept calling me during my work hours. They were very aggressive, while I understand that they were just trying to give me info about the school, it seemed very aggressive. This morning I received 3 calls from them and they were all about 1 hour to 2 hours apart. On the 4th call I finally told the guy to ""please take me off of the list"" and before I could give an explanation as to why, he hung up. Which was very very rude. So I am glad I didn't sign up. That was extremely unprofessional.","Beautiful campus, decent curriculum. Pretty terrible student body. Great if you’re a wealthy Chinese 18 year old.",I did duel enrollment here for 3 years towards a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I was able to get a good amount of credits beside all of the 25 AP classes in high school and I was able to transfer to MIT and get my Masters Degree in Computer Science. The classes are great and the staff are nice. They have great food here too.,Be careful what you say and do here. Laws don’t apply on this campus.,Administrators here hand cuff the police from doing their job which is keeping the peace. How sad.,"Amazing school in the Ivy League.

Glad to see many of the old original buildings have been preserved, while upgrading around them.",Went for a leadership summit there. Beautiful campus. Amazing food from the college dining. I have no idea how much I ate. Free bus service took us to their really cute downtown. Awesome people.,I love this school I hope in my university years I can go to this school ❤️,"I know what you're thinking and you're right.  How could such a prestigious place leave you feeling utterly disappointed? The campus lacks passion and camaraderie. There are few signs of it being the elite environment you've envisioned. Don't fret. 109 miles south, you'll find the place you were expecting; The University of Arizona. #beardown #wildcatcountry",The Most Beautiful Campus in America.,"Beautiful campus brimming with arts, sports, and social activity. Visit every season to truly admire the beauty.  Children's Gardens, Beaumont Tower, river walk, and MSU Dairy Store (for ice cream) are some absolute must-do activities.  Wharton Center for Performing Arts brings top-notch entertainment.  MSU also has world class education programs!","Greatest school on the planet! Helped open so many doors for me professionally, academically, and personally. Go PACK!",Donatos... my favorite pizza at osu...dont miss it..,"Horrible place, filled with students with no manners and disgusting fraternity homes","Corrupt University.  We just had to pay $10.00 for 1 hour of parking, so we could study.

You see these buildings they are building for performing arts.  Question, how much of a return do you get from a performing arts degree?  Does it help starving kids around the world?

As you can see from a great documentary “Inside Job”, Matt Damon narrates the truth on our corrupt economy and how the education system takes advantage of kids and families by charging $100,000’s for a degree.

Now you have to have a Masters Degree?
Another $150,000???

Guess what, my 2 brothers, my DAD and I have no degree and we all make six figuresalaries.

Don’t waste your money on an over paid education when you can get the same education with some late fees at the local library(Good Will Hunting). I promise you will get a great job, if you have the knowledge and experience.

Good luck 🍀 everyone and don’t let Rice, Harvard, or any University put you in debt for the rest of your lives, so the professors and live off you tuition.",Beautiful campus with lots of amenities.  Very crowded and difficult to get around during football games like all Universities.,"Truly one of the best comprehensive universities in the country. There are all sorts of myths attached to the university but its spot atop Burnaby mountain is fantastic. They've done a great job of improving the food an amenities over the years. 

The university is lovely in the winter, especially when the snow falls and while it's not the most modern looking campus internally and externally the school spirit and the experience as a student is fantastic. SFU's range of campuses across the lower mainland make it an excellent choice as well. 

The sports teams are fantastic and some teams are amongst the top in the country. Bus access to the university is great and a straight shot to downtown Vancouver. There are so many great things going for the university. There's plenty that justifies it as one of the top tier universities in the country. 

The University has some world-leading faculty in innovation, criminology, communications and a number of other areas. Do your research and you won't be disappointed with what you find out about SFU!","When did Texas A&M University get SO  GREEDY and MONEY HUNGRY!!?
I had two children just graduate four years ago from this institution and I don't remember all these nonrefundable fees!! 
There's now a nonrefundable New Student Conference fee of $280 (and you have to pay this if you want to be a student at this University), and there's now a nonrefundable Housing Application Fee of $75 (with no guarantee you'll get housing).  And I'm sure there'll be more nonrefundable fees lurking around the corner....I'm sure I've only hit the tip of the iceberg. 
I'm very disappointed, especially since this University continues to reach out to Ol' Aggies for support and yet they do this to their new incoming freshman. Not a good way to start off. What a shame.","This is the most beautiful UC school. I can't tell you how beautiful this school is. Also, I'm sure UCSB is highly ranked.",Great place for education. Very helpful professors and staff. Made real good friends and memories here..,"I did my undergraduate study here. The campus is very beautiful! You can see downtown Minneapolis from the school! It looks really pretty especially during Spring and Fall.

A terrible turn for a once-decent institution.",Large state university of 40K plus students. Pretty campus with a number of different architectural styles.,"Absolutely nothing to do, and I've learned very little about professional world.","Greatest university I could've asked for to do my undergrads. Prof is very knowledgeable and students are very friendly and easy going. Incredibly diverse and lots of student groups. 

Don't get me wrong - classes are no jokes and you WILL want to pull your hair out during finals. Most students eventually will find a way to deal with stress by partying hard!","Rude staff! I called inquiring information about the phD Counseling Psychology programs and a lady (with a nigerian accent) sighs underneath her breath and stated, ""What other information do u need to know about because all the information is on the website!"" People with this kind of attitude should not be employed in settings of this nature because it decreases student retention & potential new students from wanting to attend the institution. But my money wont be spent there & im NOT on financial assistance, I WAS PAYING CASH PER COURSE!!",A top class university.,The school is substantially more concerned with promoting false political propaganda than actually educating students. Save your money and put it towards an education you can use,I always have a wonderful experience every time I come here for testing! The staff is super friendly and helpful! You can tell they really care for their patients! Their is sometimes a wait but for the most part you don't have to wait that long!,"Spent my last four years here, definitely the most memorable time of my life. Highly recommended for those who pursue academic success and practical life and work skills. Luv ya forevereverever. :D","Not a student but very disappointed how the student service office is dealing with requests. Im living in the EU and tried to get any kind of helpful answer for an actually urgent matter for weeks now. First didn't get any reply at all, and then got referred to various offices that all do something but not what I need, are expensive, and can only be contacted by mail or in person (which is impossible and ridiculously time consuming when being 4500km away). Whoever replied to the emails didn't seem to have read a bit of it or didn't care at all.",I lered how to speel rally goood. 5 starts reccomand going he.,Great university. Beautiful campus.,Its a good place to visit while I was conferencing in Ottawa.,"I hired an ESL speaker who completed a bachelor's degree at the University of Victoria. I would have thought that after four years at university someone would know the difference between singular and plural. However, this employee continues to make mistakes that cost us money. For example, instead of telling a client we were available for one-hour sessions, he told a client we were available for an hour session.
He makes many other grammatical errors.
The employee told me that professors at U Vic had too many papers to grade, so the professors don't correct grammar as long as they understand the intended meaning.
As an employer, I expect people to graduate with halfway decent English.",Squirrel to student ratio is way too high - too many gangster squirrels play too hard and work way too hard to steal my bread. Let's get this bread tho,Amazing campus awesome people,The professors made my time well worth it.,"Good University, however, they should pay attention to who they hire as PhD student/Graduate Assistant professors. I had one of the worst experiences in college while taking a class about  Development & Diversity taught by a Graduate Assistant student (Nicole Fraise) who was VERY biased and unprofessional.","This school destroyed my self esteem and my willingness to smile. Day by day at this school, life seemed ever so more pointless and punishing. But alas one day, when I thought my heart could not take it anymore, I met Dhruv Patel.

I highly recommend coming for a visit if you are driving through and I will be back this fall for a football game!,Amazing place to be an entrepreneur.,"The majority of students is conservative stuck-up white kids with twisted redneck/hillbilly pride. It is extremely hard to make friends on campus if you are not white . Nobody values or cares this school outside of Knoxville. Go visit Nashville, you won’t see a single person wearing UT T-shirt or cap. UTK is known as a big party school and has been overrated.","I graduate from UTD in 2011. It was an amazing experience. I gave it four stars because I applied for graduate school here and they lost my application. It worked out for the best,  but I was upset by that. I got a B.A. in Art and Performance from here and there was a lot of really cool stuff that happened. This place has changed a lot, but still a great school.","It's a fantastic University. Hopefully you're not picking a University based on Google reviews, but if you are... They have great accreditation. Fantastic programs. Great professors. Amazing medical programs with a great teaching hospital. Go here.",Love this school. Headed here for Fall semester coming up. Looking forward to living in Tallahassee. Visited a few places and searched for a scooter. Noticed there isn't very much car parking on campus. Will be looking around for fun things to do here in the fall. Really friendly staff and a lot of diverse faces. Reminds me of back home in Miami. Happy to be here!,"I love this place.

I graduated in 2015 and feel that the CCEE department did a great job of preparing students for the work force. Although, I thought many of the general education engineering classes were too large. An added plus was the beautiful campus, along with how easy it is to walk around.","I have also attended MIT and Stanford but STONY BROOK IS THE BEST.  I learned MORE there than at either of the other two institutions .  The faculty are really great and my professors were VERY smart and they liked to spend time chatting with you.   President Stanley is also quite accessible. The campus is beautiful, filled with trees and lavishly landscaped with fountains, ponds and even a 'stony brook'.

Would highly recommend!","If you enjoy submitting paperwork to financial aid several times, calling about why the paper work has not been marked received and then being charged a late fee for paperwork you submitted 3 weeks ago and then told to file an appeal; this is the school for you.","If you're thinking of going to school here, don't. The financial aid department is incompetent, the school doesn't know how to budget for anything, and they have no problem giving students literally thousands of dollars in late fees for problems they caused (seriously, the sent me on wild goose chases for forms that DO NOT EXIST in any capacity in this version of reality). Worst 4 years of my life by a long shot. The only redeeming quality of this school is that most of the professors in the psych department are pretty good. Other than that, WSU is an overpriced scam of a party school, and you're only going to enjoy yourself if you're going to college to drink your brain cells away.",A great school! There are lots of underground tunnels that connects the buildings so it's easy to get around. They have lots of seating areas so there lots of places to sit and study. There are a lot of parking lots on campus which is awesome! It's great for those who take public transport as it's right by the O-train.,"Plsss have more parking available for students.

Also, gaaaah. I keep seeing mixed reviews here. I'm pretty set on this school, so could someone also give me advice on how to prepare to attend this sort of school? If anyone has attended this place, could you give some quick tips? Help would be much appreciated, thank you.","I submitted four transcripts in-person to UH. I was given four receipts. I called a few times to check on my application status. The first time I called, I was told they lost one of my transcripts and that I would need to resubmit it (and of course it needs to be another official one and they won't reimburse me). I submitted it and called back a couple weeks later to check on my application status. I was told rather rudely that two of my applications were processed and two were still being reviewed. When I asked approximately when they would finish reviewing them, the woman snapped at me ""there are 5,000 applications so call back later"".

I called back today to check on my application status and a woman working in admissions told me the department wouldn't make a decision on my admission until I submitted a ""missing"" transcript. I told her I already submitted it, at which point she asked ""when did you submit it?"". After locating my transcript submission receipt, I read her the date on it. She then put me on hold for two minutes to ""check  the image system"" for my transcript. She found my transcript on that system and said ""your application is now complete and a decision will be made by or before August 3rd"".

First admissions loses my transcript and make me buy another official transcript without reimbursing me.
Then they make me call back every couple weeks to check on my status. Of course they don't process one application at a time-- they have some unorganized sequence.

Then they lose another transcript. Of course they never call/email/text me to let me know so I can order another one--they rather burn the time in between my calls to them. When I do call, they need the date I submitted my transcript in order for them to find it on their second system (and if I didn't have that dated transcript, then what?).

It took her two minutes to find my transcript. How come the person reviewing my application couldn't find it in three weeks? I asked her and she said ""I don't know"". Then I asked ""isn't this kind of a dumb system?"". Of course she can't say yes while employed by the admissions department. She didn't say anything.","Aside from the ancient looking buildings and high prices on pretty much everything, it's a great place to be. Campus has everything you need to learn, stay healthy, and have fun.","cafeteria located in campus center is good , but all the products are over priced if you go on perk hours you may find it very crowded.","Most dangerous campus ever, police focus more on enforcing parking rather than safety. I have been a student here for two years. The only thing that's changed is some new facilities that still blow. Money allocation is ran by a preschool it seems like. The biology department lacks any kind of organization, I get good grades but it has been an annoying journey here. Not to mention the social events here probably costed about 500$ so yeah expect them to blow too. Overall if i didnt get a lottery scholarship to this place I would've never even considered coming here."

MIT is a member of the Association of American Universities(AAU)..",Don’t bother trying to get in. The school doesn’t actually exist. The buildings are all set pieces and the alumni are all actors. They make million a year on the application fees of hopeful students only for then all to receive rejections. Try your luck at a real school like the university of Finland.,"Super expensive school, and there is no reason to go this school unless you major in computer thingy. 

Maybe business school...? but still not that wise choice. You can go NYC business schools rather than the school in Pittsburgh.

She will have a good time here.",I am blown away by the online doctoral program and very grateful to have chosen to attend their program. I have found the professors and TAs to be outstanding and supportive.,"I had the time of my life at New York University. It’s one of the best schools in the country offering an outstanding learning experience with everything you can imagine in New York City. It was an exciting experience living and studying at NYU. I lived on campus in the NYU dormitory on Washington Square Park before moving into my own apartment on  Fifth Avenue close to classes at NYU. My father rented a very cool 😎 apartment for me suggesting I should try to find a roommate to help defray expenses. Luckily NYU is full of students in need of housing so I had no difficulty finding a roommate for my absolutely wonderful New York City apartment. After becoming friends with countless foreign students, I became engaged to a math major from another country. He worked at Cartier to supplement his scholarship to NYU, getting a 50% discount from Cartier. He bought me an engagement ring 💍 making me very happy 😊. We enjoyed our lives at New York University, enrolled in different schools and meeting for dinner when we had the time. Local restaurants in New York are absolutely amazing 😉 and can easily tempt you as an NYU student, as can all activities in this fabulous city. We established time restrictions in order to focus on our studies 📖 at NYU because it’s tempting to enjoy the New York City campus all too often. NYU is an excellent university affording a unique 😉 university experience.",We visit Japanese garden here. It is nice place worth to see.,It's so beautiful and organized. The meetings were really well organized and the people are super friendly. The location is close to most things. Loved that!,"Great college, but classes were a bit too long. I'm sorry, but i would have liked a break now and then. However, the dorms were pretty nice.","Please beware of a man by the name of Ian Jenkins MD, who happens to be an internist/hospitalist doctor and professor here at UCSD. There was an incident that occurred in which involved Jenkins and a fellow volunteer at the hospital as well as another. While he may hold great reputation, there is major uncertainty as to his intentions when it comes to his personal life as well as in the workplace. We personally wouldn't trust him. Please watch out to anyone who may be a patient/student of his. If you see this, please report any harassment/sexual misconduct immediately.","Clearly your professor Lipold has no idea about basic history and his antisemetic bias should not extend into the public university.

At the end of the day DUKE still making that $$$$... LMMFAO!!!! OKKK 👍,Beautiful school clean quiet grounds. The art of the building structures are exquisite.,"McGill is a beautiful campus, and I enjoyed visiting the Redpath Museum, which is why I visited in the first place.","Visited The Penn State University, State College, Pennsylvania. My son was selected for Masters studies in this great university. This is a research oriented major public university founded in 1855, having many campuses and facilities throughout Pennsylvania.","Purdue's teaching veterinary clinic is top notch!My kitten had a very rare health condition and wouldn't be alive if it were not for the students, vets and vet techs at the small animal hospital on campus. They were all very compassionate and knowledgeable in the type of surgery and after care my kitten would need for his rare condition. He received above excellent attention and TLC for all his needs during and after surgery and came out of there a kitten with a new lease on life! These people are professional,caring, and very well trained in their field.I would highly recommend them to anyone who appreciates excellence in the care of their pets!","As a full-time student and part-time worker, I recommend this University for any resident in Orange County or Los Angeles. The campus is great for commuting, as long as you avoid rush hour. It also is very peaceful which is optimal for a study environment. The professors in the School of Social Sciences are intelligent, passionate about their disciplines, and helpful. I am glad I cam where after community college. Zot! Zot!","Beautiful campus. Love the library, looks like the movie in Harry Potter!",Beautiful campus. Good friendships and memories made. Never had problems signing up for EE classes. Would do it again if I went back in time.,"Even though I never got accepted here, and, if I had, I would've never met Ron McClain at Valparaiso University, the campus is so amazing. 43 libraries throughout campus because it's such a huge campus.

The University of Alberta wants to give David Suzuki an honorary degree.  The University of Alberta can give whatever degree to whomever they want.  Who cares, as long as they do NOT waste tax payers' money.  However, the University of Alberta, without EVIDENCE, has stated that high school grads are more competent than university grads in the field of pharmaceutical sciences profession.  NOW that is stepping over the RED LINE because it involves in public health.  Is the University of Alberta going to be responsible if patients die or suffering from organ damage?

I believe the University of Alberta accepted bribes to make such a claim at the expense of public health.  NOW THAT IS STEPPING OVER THE RED LINE.

Ms. Rachel Notley,
Do NOT be afraid of us ethnic Chinese.  First of all, we do NOT hate you!  The reason why we do NOT get along is because you White Canadians treat us ethnic Chinese as SLAVES, with NO rights and NO equality.  Therefore, what else can we do except to minimize trade with Canada?  Our action is a normal human response.","This school is not a ""well-explained"" school, I will say that. If you are the one who isn't good at socializing, it might not be a fit for you.  Also, such a big school will not chase you down or help you at any time, you should find them by yourselves or else you will do poorly at first when you start your freshman year in UC Davis.",Awesome food and tons of cool places to explore.,"You are correct, this school is a disgrace. The vandalism which should be prosecuted to the full extent shows the lack of education provided. There is NO such thing as ""out of sight out of mind"". History will always be there and if you students had spent all that money at a better school you would know that. I am from NC and for 53 years have poured my heart and soul into being a Tar Heel fan. I have a UNC tattoo which I will not remove because it's a part of MY history and i am not as ignorant as the students that took matters into their own hands. Guess what students, history is still here and the only thing you have changed is the fact that now you ARE what you say you hate so much.","I have been an online student for 2.5 years mostly in the graduate program. This organization is flat so no one is overseeing the professors there, they do pretty much whatever they want. They even say so in their lectures. Very snobbish. Online classes are very chaotic. Every single online class I took has errors in the documents, schedules are not updated on the first day of class, the book information is not posted ahead of time so you pay expedited shipping to get it asap, and some of the teaching assistants (for the undergrad classes) have only undergrad degrees. The sad thing is that the tuition for the graduate coursework is almost $3000 per course. To have all these organizational problems in my opinion is not acceptable when you charge this kind of money. Proctoring service changed again. Now you have to find your own proctor and they give you only one day to take an exam - no flexibility neither for the proctor nor for online students who are working. Other than the fact that this is an accredited university (it is a public one), if you are looking for security, there is nothing else there that would be attractive. Online classes are pretty much a nightmare over there from the organizational perspective.",I love IU. Very diverse in a liberal college town.,"Beautiful campus grounds and nice people from different cities, states, and countries cooperating on groundbreaking things together.","Good school, attractive campus. Only thing I really didn't like as a student was that printing something was not free and was like breaking into Fort Knox, multiple login screens and approvals before you can finally print. After paying thousands of dollars to go here the amount of restrictions they put on the printers is ridiculous. Lots of administrative staff and overhead that in my opinion takes away from students and student funds (and increases tuition). I have met teachers that agree with this sentiment.

Don't buy textbooks for any class unless your teacher specifically recommends it, they are waste of money. I almost never used mine even when they did recommend to get it and I currently have an $800 TV stand that the bookstore offered me $30 for. 

Wolfline was great when I needed it. Parking has become more and more expensive and the meter maids are snipers, do not park without a pass you WILL get caught and they will boot your car if they catch you sharing passes, which they certainly will now that they can automatically scan everyones license plates and passes at the same time.

Great international office, professors and campus both at Smith and the faculty of Law!","The beautiful campus is a nice place to take a stroll in the early morning or late afternoon. In the evening, the water fountains are beautifully illuminated, and so is the interesting installation ""Twilight Epiphany"" Skyspace by James Turrell.",Treats their veterans like criminals.  Do you want your disbursement when you are supposed to get it?!  Once a veteran didnt pay them.  So now ALL veterans have to sign a letter saying that they wont steal.  Women are treated as a commodity to get into parties.  Garbage school.  Garbage staff.  This school is putting your child's life at risk with it's transportation system.,"GREEDY BUSINESS!!! From my first day transferring here, I have had a BAD experience! They didn't accept ANY of my transfer credits and insisted I can study somewhere else if I am not satisfied with the decision. Courses are luck - only one I'm taking is not awful. TAs are like summer camp instructors - absolutely out of the loop and an insult to the money I pay for tuition.

You can't beat the #1 ranked college food in the nation!,Great school but in a run down area. Therun down area is better however compared to North Chicago and Waukegan. Those towns are the most ghetto places I have ever seen in the Chicago area. The look very awful when you drive by. Those towns do interestly preserve quite a bit of history though.,"Completed my Civ.Eng. undergrad at Mac. 
Wonderful university with a beautiful campus and excellent programs.",The price of this uni is crazy 60k once you add the cost of room & board. The only good thing they have to lure students in is there CO-OP programs but honestly other universities offer similar aid to get CO-OPs if you have gotten into Harvard or MIT go there instead its more affordable and even at 50k the programs offer you more. If your a normal student then this is the place for you.,If you like Marxism and other socialist propaganda you'll love this place like most universities today they'll just try and brainwash your children and becoming something they are not and I'll just pump him up with lies such as one and four women are sexually assaulted on college campuses which what father in their right mind would ever send their daughter to school that were true they teach him things like white privilege which is bologna they teach him things about systematic racism they just pump their kids full of hate and throw in the real world perhaps they should teach them real skills and teach him how to be successful and perhaps these things that they're preaching about will naturally go away rather than creating more hatred from the inside,"Visited the Boulder Campus for an ASU vs Colorado football game. Colorado prevailed 😪. However we still enjoyed our overall experience as the stadium staff was very welcoming & the Colorado fans were gracious in their team’s victory. Hence, I will be rooting for the Buffaloes to have success thru the remainder of their 2018 season. And I look forward to them visiting us in Tempe in 2019 - and I will be rooting for our Sun Devils to improve & be victorious on our home field. “Forks up” 🌵 !!","Albert the gator mascot ate me out in the feminist get together room around the 2nd auditorium, the best part was he said he would do it again at the LGBTQ+ festival on main street.","Beautiful campus!  Lots to see when walking around inside and out!  As a student I was treated as a number not a person.  Their priority is clearly to make money, not support their students.  There should be a better balance between the two.",The downtown campus is close to everything but if you want some peace and quiet I would suggest living at the Loyola campus. It is nice and is only one street away from St.Catherine's St. so that is a plus.,"Obviously has the best meme page of all the Ivies.  Big campus life, cold in winter, large Native American Community on Campus and Meryl Streep was here for a term. Shonda Rhines and Mindy Kaling also graced us with their presence. Not a cutthroat academic environment, great wildlife and very picturesque all seasons, housing is a mess, but its more affordable to live off campus anyways.",This is The best university out of all ive attended,Teach your staff the basics of customer service.,"I really wish I could give this University a 5/5 review as I thought this was my dream univeristy ever since a young child. However I just completed my second year at Uvic and to be completely honest, it has been the worst two years of my life. The only reason as to why I dislike this University is because of the administration. By that I mean, it seems as if they do not care about their students, and that they treat their students just like numbers. For most of my time in class it almost seems as if they want students fail on purpose. I believe it's a serious problem if for example is one course, over 65% of the students fail shouldn't the admin be looking at the profs rubic and assist students in a better way of passing. I mean, yes there aee some students who do not try hard has others but the ones who do, like myself and my peers - we should be able to have proper tools and guidance for passing this course because at the end of the day it's the students who lose money not the University. Moreover I believe most of the profs specially in the math and economics faculty seem to have no clue what there doing but the ones who do are rarely teaching unfortunately. They are very old school in their teaching and I would highly recommend not attending this school, specially if you are international because to them you are just money grab. They will increase tuition up to 20 percent this upcoming fall semester. Other than that the campus is beautiful but the food is way to over priced!",Attending my friend’s commencement here. Talked to some professors and students here and I felt the professors and staffs really care about their students. The graduate students here also enjoyed the study and the research they are doing.,Beautiful univirsty good edguistion well teaching,A beautiful university with full of natural beauty. Really a big and huge campus.,Just another joke of a school filled with staff pushing their own agenda. They claim to be diverse unless you don't believe what they want you to believe. This is just another example of why the rest of the world sits back and laughs at the United States.,Great school with advanced laboratories. Only fault is the dinning halls......,An incredibly beautiful campus.,"Stopped in about 10 years back...beautiful campus, clean and quiet","I went to UCSC for a waterpolo camp last year, and the campus was beautiful. The pool was great, the dorms were so cool, and the campus was unimaginable. We saw deer walking on the campus, a turkey, and some huge trees. I don't have the best grades so I don't know if I would ever even be able to get in here, but if you are considering going here I definitely recommend it.","Notre Dame is a great school, and because they are part of Questbridge, a remarkable scholarship, my daughter (not a legacy) is enjoying a top notch education that we otherwise would not be able to afford.",Nice school,"They are very picky about general education classes. I was going to transfer to UTK to finish my bachelors after I earned my associate’s degree in another state, but I figured out that they don’t take many out-state credits and pretty much I’d have to start all over again. So if you’re an out-state student, you need to be careful and make sure how many credits you can transfer.","Not trying to be negative, neither am I angry but, if you dont have enough money, dont come here. Best to come with a car but beware of parking. Social life is horrible, focus is mostly on studies. I wouldn't endorse it as a good business school, you are pretty much on your own if you are a business student because the school expenses is not worth its value, you deserve better than this money hungry establishment, it is only good for STEM majors. Apart from that, the school is good for nothing else. Overall, its not a bad school. I'm new to this country, so i dont know much about schools and i made the mistake of choosing this school thinking i would get a good education (i saw it was among the top 5 best business schools in Texas) only to find myself stressed and anxious from course-load and having to work to pay my tuition and take care of myself. No college life, just slaving myself to grades that just wouldn't get better unless you are a complete genius, i cant wait to leave this place. Save yourself and dont come here, there has to be a better school than UTD!",I WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE TO GO TO SUCH A GREAT HOME. THAT IS RIGHT A SCHOOL THAT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE A ivy league school with a grand campus nothing lacking with  light rail and buses every 15 minutes.

Yeah you will love it boys and girls you can be proud to graduate this unique university in the foothills of the Wasatch mountains. And the greatest snow on earth MAY BE I AUGHT TO PULL A Rodney Danger field at 63 Now darn it I can dream about it.,"Great for a state school.  Obviously, it depends on your major, but FSU recruits extremely well for a small price.  Also has a great atmosphere to it.  Highly recommend!","I am applying as a transfer student from Northern Virginia Community College, and it has been nothing but me chasing down administration to make sure all of the paperwork has been processed properly.  Every email I have sent the admissions office so far has taken at LEAST two weeks response time, even when I send follow-up emails.  They say that their response time is 48 hours, but obviously my experience is nowhere close.  It's not the beginning of a semester, it's almost October, so to me it makes no sense that it should be taking so long for a response.  I called on the phone, and while the lady was nice, she couldn't provide me any specific information pertaining to MY application.  Going in person is horrible because I have to pay for parking, receptionists are rude and act like I'm inconveniencing them, and my questions have been turned away before because I am not a George Mason student.  Well, obviously I WANT to be a Mason student, that's why I'm here in the first place!  I'm not even going to school here yet and it's already been a nightmare dealing with the administration side of the school.  I feel unimportant, not prioritized in the slightest, and a nuisance for wanting to be sure.

UPDATE: Tried to call several times because I was not receiving email responses. Twice, I was on hold for OVER an hour and my phone either died or I had to hang up the phone because I had other things I had to do. Going in person is not convenient for me in any capacity, but I finally went. All I was told was that my transfer application was complete and went through the system... It's also been a week since admissions said they would begin notifying transfer applicants of admission, as Mason students are already registering for classes and I want to secure my spot, too. Radio silence from the admission team. Only email I have received is that my application was received... Which was almost three weeks after I submitted it, by the way. 

Currently on hold so I can ask when the admission letters will be administered.

UPDATE #2: 
I was finally accepted into the university after I insisted I speak to someone in charge who could actually fix an issue that was never my fault in the first place. So a literal WEEK before classes start, I finally get my damned acceptance. After pulling my hair out, having to call late into work only to be given a shoulder shrug and ""there's nothing I can do"". I'm going here because it is the most cost effective school for me, so I had no choice but to chase people all over creation. If I had other schools on my lost, I would've turned around long ago because of the absolute nightmare the admissions office has been. I did my part by submitting my application the day that submissions were opened, and I had to wait 3 months for a decision I was told would take 3 weeks. I will get my degree and I sure as hell will not be giving them my money for grad school. All you are is money to them. Another $100k in their pocket. They don't care about you at all.",I think this uni. is very good,"Without any bias, this University needs some work on its diversity. Be on this it's a large campus that can be very confusing for a newcomer. Sports why's this University is on the up-and-up, however they are always still getting owned by the University of Iowa, which as a University of Iowa student, warms my heart to no end.

Now they are practically discriminating me because a have a first offense misdemeanor who’s gonna be expunged this September. So I’m gonna speak with the judge and told her to stop referring students and firsts offenders because they are not accepting. I applied to others universities and they accept me but this one really frustrated my dreams. I keep waiting for the supposed returned calls to solve this no one is willing to help me.

Many friendly people and nice places to go. Great professors (although the TAs can usually be harsh graders). The downsides were mainly for the people who lived on campus. You cannot be an RA if you are a STEM Major. The fresh food company for on campus student usually has low quality food and only serve at specific times (the new dining hall is better). But the biggest downside to this university is their financial services and financial aid department. Most of the people working in this department act like they wish they weren't there and half of them give you an attitude or make it seem like they don't want to talk to you. Great gym though. Overall 2 stars,Great time walking around as a visitor. Super cold from the blizzard. They should've built some connections underground above ground like many other universities I've been to. Besides that it was gorgeous. Go Bisons!,"I work here as staff and find the working environment pretty good.  My bosses have been good, my coworkers are dependable, and the students seem well behaved and conscientious (most of the time). The new buildings are nice, and the harbor walk is kind of amazing, and the beach is very chill. Good luck finding a place as tranquil anywhere else near the city.  There is however one small con and one big con.. the small con is that there aren't that many places to eat and Sodexo runs all the food on campus, and their attempts at ethnic foods are sad.  And the aforementioned big con is that there is no less than 3 buildings being built on this tight peninsula right now, and one huge building that was taken down over the year I've been here.. the construction is a mess.  Though the new, finished buildings, like the science complex, are great.  But if you can take the T somehow, as I do, this place is fantastic.","""SHAME ON GOOGLE FOR CENSORING MY REVIEW AND OTHERS

University does discrmination among the students in respect of grading. UNM does not treat students equally. There is discrimination made among the students. Title IX coordinators are part of university administration. So, if any unlawful acts happen and even if you complain to title IX coordinators; nothing will work. You may choose to join UNM; but if you suffer in any unlawful acts; no one will care until you go to police, courts and department of justice. This is the TRUTH. If you plan to join; you may need to prepare some precautions before you join.. best of luck.

Discrimination case at UNM (please check):

Hello Prof ******,
Does the TA work as volunteer/ without payment? I would like to know. 

I was at ** in last weekend. I talked with my friend. Her name is ""*****"". She is ***  student and joined *** in spring 2015. All of her **** Univ courses got transferred by June, 2015. She completed all of her transfer process by her first year.

My Case: I joined UNM *** program in fall 2015. I worked to transfer my courses in January, 2016. I got my transfer result in February, 2016.In my case, *** told, they can transfer 2 courses. In January 2017, I again e-mailed to my dept regarding my ***** Univ course transfer. program coordinator told me, they already made decision and its final. After that, I met with *** chair, Prof *****, regarding my course transfer and I e-mailed him as well. I asked him the reason, ""why ,my courses are not transferred?"" He replied me, ""everyone may not be treated in same way.""

you can check my and ***`s ****** univ transcripts. Why should i be discriminated?? She made the transfer within her first year. And, why i am not treated in same way??

WHY??? WHY AM I TREATED IN DIFFERENT WAY??? This is my question.

I had course with Prof ***** in Spring 2017. It was a lab course. I was given ""B"" and my **** partner was given ""A-"". I e-mailed Prof *****, ""why am i given ""B""?? I wrote 3 reports out of 4 and it requires lots of effort to write the reports."" He immediately changed my grade to ""B+"". Should I need to bargain for my grades??? It was not the first time that happened to me. I also had ""same"" experience in my first semester. My final exam, midterm, assignments were better and i was given ""A-"". I claimed to check my answer sheets and I found, I was not given marks to some answers (both in midterm and final). My grade raised. But, prof. raised other student`s grades without any reason.
